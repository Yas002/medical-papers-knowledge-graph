    "The objective of this review is to compare the e ectiveness, tolerability, and safety of gas (carbon dioxide) and liquid (normal saline) used for uterine distension during outpatient hysteroscopy.",
    "We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO on 28 April 2021.We checked references of relevant trials and contacted study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies.CINAHL records and ongoing trials from the trial registries were included in the CENTRAL search.",
    "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing saline with carbon dioxide, as well as RCTs comparing saline at di erent temperatures, for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy done for any indication.",
    "We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.Primary review outcomes were patient tolerability and adverse events or complications related to the distending medium.Secondary outcomes were quality of the hysteroscopic view and duration of the procedure.",
    "We included 12 RCTs (1946 women) .The quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate: the main limitations were risk of bias due to absence of blinding due to the nature of the procedure, imprecision, and inconsistency.",
    "Analysis ruled out a clinically relevant di erence in pain scores during the procedure between saline and carbon dioxide, but the quality of evidence was low (standardised mean di erence (SMD) -0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.17 to 0.02; 9 RCTs, N = 1705; I = 86%).This translates to di erences of 0.39 cm (lower) and 0.05 cm (higher) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS).Evidence was insu icient to show",
    "The womb is a hollow organ.A hysteroscope is an apparatus that is introduced inside the womb to see inside the cavity.If one is to see, the cavity needs to be filled with a clear substance (distension medium).This substance can be liquid (saline solution) or gas (carbon dioxide).Warming liquid to body temperature was suggested to improve patient tolerability.Each substance has benefits and side e ects, which we have compared here.",
    "We found 12 randomised controlled trials comparing distension media in a total of 1946 women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy.Evidence is current to April 2021.",
    "Pain during the procedure may be similar with saline and carbon dioxide.We are uncertain whether saline is as tolerable as carbon dioxide in terms of proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain and the need to use painkillers.Saline is probably associated with fewer side e ects than carbon dioxide.Saline may be superior to carbon dioxide in terms of quality of the hysteroscopic view.Evidence is inconclusive for duration of the procedure.",
    "Compared to room temperature saline, warm saline may reduce pain scores.Evidence is inconclusive for other outcomes in this comparison.",
    "Mean (SD) pain score during the procedure was 2.74 (2.3) cm on 10-cm VAS b SMD 0.07 SD lower (0.17 lower to 0.02 higher) 1705 (9 RCTs) ⊕⊕⊝⊝ LOW c,d This translates to a difference of 0.16 cm lower on 10-cm VAS with saline (0.39 cm lower to 0.05 cm higher) b",
    "Procedures abandoned due to intense pain 43 *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).",
    "The uterine cavity is a virtual space that is lined by the endometrium.There is a need to assess the uterine cavity and the endometrium in women with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), infertility, or suspected genital tract congenital anomalies.",
    "In addition to performing assessment, obtaining an endometrial sample may be required in some cases (Munro 2011).",
    "Several options are available to assess the inside of the uterus, including two-dimensional ultrasonography, three-dimensional ultrasonography, saline infusion sonohysterography, hysteroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (Bingol 2011; Farquhar 2003; Seshadri 2014) .Dilatation and curettage (D&C) was used in the past to investigate the uterine cavity and to obtain an endometrial sample.However, D&C is considered obsolete because it is a blind method with low sensitivity for local and pedunculated intracavitary lesions.Further disadvantages of D&C include the need for hospital admission and general anaesthesia (Bettocchi 2001) .",
    "Hysteroscopy involves the introduction of a lighted scope through the cervix to visualise the uterine cavity.Hysteroscopy has replaced D&C for many cases requiring investigation of the uterine cavity.",
    "With direct visualisation of the uterine cavity, organic lesions are not missed and directed biopsy can be performed (Bedner 2007; Clark 2018) .Hysteroscopy in an o ice setting was described in 1969 by Leidenheimer (Leidenheimer 1969) .He used an instrument called the Silander hysteroscope, which was originally described by Torsten Silander in 1963 (Silander 1963) .O ice hysteroscopy in general is preferable, as it o ers the advantages of being minimally invasive, can be done without general anaesthesia for diagnostic purposes, and has low cost and quick recovery time.",
    "In addition, some surgical interventions can be performed in the same setting -'see and treat' (Robinson 2013).O ice hysteroscopy has a necessary role in the diagnostic workup for heavy menstrual bleeding (NICE guidelines 2018).The 'traditional' approach for hysteroscopy requires introduction of a vaginal speculum to separate vaginal walls and to visualise the cervix, followed by use of a forceps to grasp the cervix.On the other hand, the new 'vaginoscopic' approach is done by guiding the hysteroscope inside the vagina that is distended by the media without the use of vaginal instruments (Cooper 2010; Smith 2019).",
    "Since this procedure was introduced, several modifications to outpatient hysteroscopy have been proposed, aimed at decreasing the associated pain and improving satisfaction for patients and operators.Decreasing the diameter of the hysteroscope (minihysteroscope < 3.5 mm) and using the no-touch 'vaginoscopic' approach are examples of such modifications that may result in less pain and better tolerability of outpatient hysteroscopy (Evangelista 2011).",
    "As the uterine cavity is a virtual space, it needs to be distended by a medium under pressure if the whole cavity and the tubal ostia are to be visualised (Rioux 1984) .Currently, the media in use include gas as carbon dioxide and liquid as saline that can be used at room temperature or warmed to body temperature (Brusco 2003) .",
    "Problems linked to the type of distension media include pelvic pain, shoulder-tip pain, and endometrial bleeding.These problems can negatively influence image quality and patient satisfaction (Evangelista 2011).",
    "The search for the perfect gaseous or liquid distension media continues, as both methods o er advantages and disadvantages (Litta 2003; Nagele 1996; Paschopoulos 2004; Raimondo 2010) .This review aims to summarise the evidence for all distension media in current use.",

    "Women undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy for all indications were eligible for inclusion.",
    "Outpatient hysteroscopy using gas or liquid for uterine distension was eligible.",
    "We considered studies for inclusion in this review if they were appropriately designed to evaluate outcome measures relevant to patient and operator satisfaction when outpatient hysteroscopy using carbon dioxide or normal saline as a distension medium is performed.",
    "1. Tolerability of the procedure, assessed as a. pain experienced by women during the procedure, excluding pain during introduction of the hysteroscope, based on pain scores b. proportion of procedures abandoned or terminated owing to patient pain or discomfort c. the need for analgesia 2. Operative and postoperative adverse events and complications, including shoulder-tip pain, vagal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and fainting attack), bleeding from the endometrium, and infection",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "1. Quality of the hysteroscopic view, assessed as a. operator's description of the clarity of the view on a specified scale b. proportion of procedures with an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view 2. Length of time to complete the procedure 3. Cost implications",
    "We searched for all published and unpublished RCTs studying distension media in outpatient hysteroscopy in consultation with the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGF) Information Specialist on 28 April 2021.",
    "We searched the following electronic databases for relevant trials:",
    "We handsearched the reference lists of relevant trials and systematic reviews retrieved by the search and contacted experts in the field to obtain additional trials.We also handsearched relevant journals and conference abstracts that are not covered in the CGF Specialised Register, in liaison with the Information Specialist.",
    "Ongoing trials from trial registries (clinicaltrials.govand the World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform search portal) were included in the CENTRAL search.",
    "Titles and abstracts of search results were initially screened independently by two review authors (KSA and MB), a er which we retrieved the full texts of potentially eligible studies.Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently examined all full-text articles and selected studies meeting the Review eligibility criteria for inclusion.When papers contained insu icient information to permit a decision about eligibility, we attempted to contact study investigators to seek further details.We resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author (BWJM).We documented the selection process by using a PRISMA flow chart.",
    "Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently extracted data from eligible studies using a data extraction form.We resolved disagreements by discussion.Extracted data included study characteristics and outcome data (see Characteristics of included studies tables).We collated multiple reports of the same trial under a single study ID with multiple references.We attempted to contact study investigators for further information on methods and/or results, if required.We included studies irrespective of whether outcomes were reported in a usable way.In multi-arm studies, we excluded data from arms that did not meet eligibility criteria.",
    "Two review authors (KSA and MAG) independently assessed the included studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' assessment tool (Higgins 2011).We assessed the following domains: selection bias (random sequence generation and allocation concealment); performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding of outcome assessors); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data); reporting bias (selective reporting); and other bias.We assigned judgements as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, Section 8.5 (Higgins 2011).We resolved disagreements by discussion.We described all judgements in detail and presented our conclusions in the 'Risk of bias' table in the Characteristics of included studies section.We incorporated these conclusions into our interpretation of review findings by means of sensitivity analyses (see Sensitivity analysis).",
    "For dichotomous data, we used the numbers of events in both groups of each study to calculate Peto odds ratios (Peto ORs).",
    "For continuous outcomes, we calculated mean di erences (MDs) between treatment groups when outcomes were reported with the same scale.We calculated standardised mean di erences (SMDs) when outcomes were reported on di erent scales.We reversed the direction of e ect of individual studies, when required, to ensure consistency across trials.We treated ordinal data as continuous data.We presented all outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).When data to calculate ORs and SMDs were not available, we utilised the most numerical data available (e.g.test statistics, P values).We assessed whether estimates calculated in the review for individual studies were compatible in each case with estimates reported in the study publications.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "The primary analysis was per woman randomised.Data that did not allow valid analysis were briefly summarised in an additional table and were not meta-analysed.",
    "We analysed data on an intention-to-treat basis as far as possible (i.e.including all randomised participants in analysis, in the groups to which they were randomised).Attempts were made to obtain missing data from the original trialists.We did not undertake imputation, and we analysed only available data.",
    "We considered whether the clinical and methodological characteristics of included studies were su iciently similar for meta-analysis to provide a clinically meaningful summary.We assessed statistical heterogeneity using I .We considered I greater than 50% to indicate substantial heterogeneity (Higgins 2011).",
    "In view of the di iculty of detecting and correcting for publication bias and other reporting biases, we aimed to minimise their potential impact by ensuring a comprehensive search for eligible studies and by being alert for duplication of data.We planned to use a funnel plot to explore the possibility of small-study e ects (i.e.tendency for estimates of the intervention e ect to be more beneficial in smaller studies) if 10 or more studies were included in the same analysis.",
    "If studies were su iciently similar, we combined the data using a fixed-e ect model in the following comparisons.",

    "We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 2014).",
    "We included no preplanned subgroup analyses in this review.",
    "If we noted substantial heterogeneity (I > 50%), we planned to explore di erences between studies that might account for the heterogeneity.We took any statistical heterogeneity into account when interpreting the results, especially if we noted any variation in the direction of e ect.",
    "We conducted sensitivity analyses for the primary outcomes to determine whether conclusions were robust to arbitrary decisions made regarding eligibility and analysis.These analyses included consideration of whether review conclusions would have di ered if:",
    "1. eligibility had been restricted to studies at low risk of bias, defined as studies at low risk of selection bias; 2. a random-e ects model had been adopted; or 3. risk ratio had been used as the summary e ects measure.",
    "We prepared a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADEpro and Cochrane methods (GRADEpro GDT 2015; Higgins 2011) .This table evaluated the overall quality of the body of evidence for the main comparison (saline versus carbon dioxide) while addressing the review outcomes: patient tolerability (pain during the procedure, procedures abandoned due to intense pain, need for analgesia), adverse events and complications (vasovagal reaction, shoulder-tip pain, endometrial bleeding, infection), quality of the hysteroscopic view (clarity of the view on a scale, procedures with an unsatisfactory view), and duration of the procedure.An additional 'Summary of findings' table was prepared for the main review outcomes for the other comparison (warm saline versus room temperature saline).We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE criteria: risk of bias, consistency of e ect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias.Two review authors working independently (KSA and MAG) made judgements about evidence quality (high, moderate, low, or very low), with disagreements resolved by discussion.We justified, documented, and incorporated judgements into reporting of results for each outcome.We extracted study data, formatted our comparisons in data tables, and prepared 'Summary of findings' tables before writing the results and conclusions of our review.",
    "The search yielded 730 records, in addition to two records identified through other sources.Twenty-four studies were potentially eligible and were retrieved in full text (Figure 1 ); 12 of these met our inclusion criteria (Characteristics of included studies).We excluded eight studies (Characteristics of excluded studies), and four are awaiting classification (Characteristics of studies awaiting classification).",
    "We included 12 trials in this systematic review.All studies were parallel-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs).Of theses 12 trials, one was a conference abstract (Garbin 2000) , and the other 11 were published as full articles (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Evangelista 2011; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Paschopoulos 2004; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004; Tawfek 2019) .",

    "Saline at di erent temperatures was used in studies comparing warm saline with room temperature saline: 37.5°C in two studies (Evangelista 2011; Tawfek 2019), and 36°C in one study (Isaat 2017).One of the trials comparing saline with carbon dioxideused warm saline at 36°C (Almeida 2008).",
    "All 12 studies included in the analysis reported pain during the procedure.A standardised 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS), with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst pain, was used to measure pain in 11 studies (Almeida 2008; Diniz 2009; Evangelista 2011; Garbin 2000; Isaat 2017; Mazzon 2014; Pellicano 2003; Pluchino 2010; Raimondo 2010; Shankar 2004; Tawfek 2019) .One study used ranking from 0 to 3 to measure pain experienced during the procedure, with 0 indicating no pain and 3 indicating severe pain not allowing completion of the procedure (Paschopoulos 2004).One study measured pain using another scale (present pain intensity (PPI) scale from 0 to 5), with 0 indicating no pain and 5 indicating excruciating pain, as well as a VAS (Shankar 2004) .",

    "Saline may be associated with fewer procedures with an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view than carbon dioxide (Peto OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.82; 5 RCTs, N = 1082; I = 67%; low-quality evidence; Analysis 1.6).This suggests that if the chance of an unsatisfactory hysteroscopic view with carbon dioxide is 9%, this chance would be between 3% and 8% with saline.Four studies reported duration of the procedure in this comparison; two studies reported the duration in minutes (Almeida 2008; Pellicano 2003) , and two other studies reported the duration in seconds (Mazzon 2014; Raimondo 2010).Due to marked heterogeneity in reported results (I = 95%), we did not pool the results in this analysis.The procedure was shorter with saline in three studies: Almeida 2008 (MD -55.80 seconds, 95% CI -99.15 to -12.45; N = 64), Mazzon 2014 (MD -26.50 seconds, 95% CI -33.17 to -19.83; N = 392), and Pellicano 2003 (MD -120.00 seconds, 95% CI -178.28 to -61.72; N = 189], and the duration was similar in both arms in the fourth study (Raimondo 2010) (MD -3.00 seconds, 95% CI -6.15 to 0.15; N = 264).",

    "No explanation for the high heterogeneity was discovered in analyses of the quality of the hysteroscopic view (Analysis 1.6).The high heterogeneity in analysis of duration of the procedure may be related to the di erence in operator experience (clinical heterogeneity) (Analysis 1.7), but because of marked heterogeneity and non-overlap of confidence intervals, we did not perform the meta-analysis.",
    "We did not construct a funnel plot for any analysis because all analyses included fewer than 10 studies.",
    "We are uncertain whether saline and carbon dioxide are similarly tolerable among patients undergoing outpatient hysteroscopy because the quality of evidence is very low to low.However, carbon dioxide probably causes more adverse events (vasovagal reaction and shoulder-tip pain) than saline (moderate-quality evidence).",

    "Pain scores during the procedure using warm saline might be lower than those when room temperature saline is used (low-quality evidence).However, studies with low risk of selection bias failed to show a di erence in pain scores between the two interventions.Therefore, extreme caution should be taken when results for this outcome are interpreted.We are uncertain of the e ects of warm saline on the proportion of procedures abandoned due to intense pain and on the need for analgesia because the quality of evidence is very low.Infection, the only adverse event reported for this comparison, did not occur with either medium.",
    "Procedural duration may be similar with warm and room temperature saline (low-quality evidence).No studies for this comparison reported on quality of the hysteroscopic view nor on cost implications.",
    "Outpatient hysteroscopy is a widely used tool that allows diagnosis and a few therapeutic interventions.It provides the benefit of visualisation of intrauterine lesions.Moreover, it is done in an outpatient setting without general anaesthesia.As a result, the patient is aware of what is happening, and this makes it more di icult for both the patient and the operator to perform than other procedures done under general anaesthesia.Searching for the best uterine distension medium that is most tolerable, has the fewest side e ects, and at the same time gives the best hysteroscopic view is challenging.",
    "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the uterine distension media identified in this review are few.Most of these trials have investigated saline versus carbon dioxide.Studies included participants with di erent characteristics (nullipara and multipara, reproductive age and menopausal women) undergoing hysteroscopy for any indication (infertility or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)) without analgesia or anaesthesia in an outpatient setting.This variation gives results the advantage of generalisability, along with clinical heterogeneity, as most outcomes are dependent on these factors.Hysteroscopes used across studies varied in the diameter of their outer sheaths.These di erences, as well as variation in operator experience, can a ect patient tolerability (Pluchino 2010).The approach of the introduction of the hysteroscope into the vagina and the cervix also varied across studies.Some studies used di erent approaches in di erent study groups.In other studies, patients underwent surgical procedures or endometrial biopsies in the same setting when necessary.All these clinical di erences might have given rise to di erent treatment e ects and could have accounted for the high statistical heterogeneity noted in subjective outcomes.None of the studies reported cost implications of both media, which might be important in considering the best medium, especially if other outcomes show similar results.",
    "We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall evidence in this review, which ranged from very low to moderate quality (see Figure 2 ; Summary of findings 1; Summary of findings 2).We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "The major limitation of this review is the small number of identified studies, preventing us from giving robust conclusions.Another limitation is the high risk of performance and selection biases because the main outcomes are subjective and are patient-or operator-reported, and blinding to the allocated intervention was not possible, especially when the media studied were gas versus liquid.Therefore, this might have influenced the results of individual studies.",
    "We ran a thorough search of databases using comprehensive strategies with the help of the Information Specialist in the CGF Group, to ensure inclusion of all eligible studies.We handsearched references of included studies as well as similar systematic reviews on the same intervention.We could not construct funnel plots to detect publication bias because each comparison included fewer than 10 studies.",
    "We tried to contact all authors of included and excluded studies, as well as authors of trial registrations, to confirm eligibility, but most authors did not respond to our emails.",
    "We identified two previous systematic reviews that compared only saline to carbon dioxide (Cooper 2011; Craciunas 2013).We intended to include any RCT comparing any two or more distension media, to make the review more comprehensive and to draw conclusions on the best distension medium in outpatient hysteroscopy.",
    "This review found insu icient evidence that saline might be associated with the same pain scores as carbon dioxide, in keeping with the results of Cooper 2011, but not with the findings of Craciunas 2013, which concluded that pain scores were lower with the use of saline.Both reviews, however, included quasi-randomised trials that were excluded from this review to prevent selection bias.Nevertheless, the results of this review are consistent with those of both reviews that saline is associated with fewer side e ects (shoulder-tip pain and vasovagal reaction).",
    "Evidence is insu icient to conclude that there are di erences between di erent distension media used for uterine distension in outpatient hysteroscopy in terms of patient tolerability, operator satisfaction, and duration of the procedure.However, saline was superior to carbon dioxide in producing fewer adverse events (shoulder-tip pain and vasovagal reaction).",
    "More high-quality well-designed RCTs comparing gaseous and liquid distension media or liquid media at di erent temperatures are needed.These studies should standardise -or include in a powered subgroup analysis -the patient's menopausal state (reproductive age versus post menopause), parity (nullipara versus multipara), indication of hysteroscopy, size of the hysteroscope, hysteroscopic approach, and operator experience, with avoidance of any surgical manoeuvres in the same setting.Also, future studies should consider performing cost-e ectiveness analyses in comparing di erent media.",
