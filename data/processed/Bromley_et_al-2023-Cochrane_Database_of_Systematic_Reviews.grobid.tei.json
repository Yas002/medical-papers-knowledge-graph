    "Prenatal exposure to certain anti-seizure medications (ASMs) is associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations (MCM).The majority of women with epilepsy continue taking ASMs throughout pregnancy and, therefore, information on the potential risks associated with ASM treatment is required.",
    "To assess the e ects of prenatal exposure to ASMs on the prevalence of MCM in the child.",
    "For the latest update of this review, we searched the following databases on 17 February 2022: Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to February 16, 2022) , SCOPUS (1823 onwards), and ClinicalTrials.gov,WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).No language restrictions were imposed.",
    "We included prospective cohort controlled studies, cohort studies set within pregnancy registries, randomised controlled trials and epidemiological studies using routine health record data.Participants were women with epilepsy taking ASMs; the two control groups were women without epilepsy and untreated women with epilepsy.",
    "ASMs readily cross the placenta from the mother into the foetusus (Brent 2004 ; Tetro 2017).Prospective observational studies (e.g.Milan Study 1999), registry-based studies (e.g.Tomson 2011), case-control studies (Jentink 2010a) , and epidemiological studies using datasets of routine health records (e.g.Denmark Health Record Registers) provide evidence of an association between ASM treatment and an increased prevalence of major congential malformations.The level of risk varies for di erent types of ASM, with first trimester valproate (VPA) exposure associated with the largest increase in prevalence (EURAP 2018; Meador 2006; Milan Study 1999; North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register; UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register).The mechanisms through which prenatal exposure to ASMs are associated with an increased prevalence of major malformations likely di ers by treatment type and may be multifactorial.This review investigates the outcomes for monotherapy treatment with di erent ASMs to identify currently available evidence on which to base treatment decisions.",
    "The decision to continue ASM treatment during pregnancy requires taking a risk-benefit decision.On the one hand, there is the potential risk posed to the foetus when the medication is a teratogen yet on the other hand, there is the health and well-being of the mother, who requires treatment throughout her pregnancy to minimise the risk of seizures (Tomson 2015); the choice of ASM depends on the type of epilepsy and the seizures (Marson 2007).A lack of knowledge regarding foetal safety limits treatment options for women with epilepsy in their childbearing years, as women and their doctors may avoid ASMs with limited data.Conversely, a lack of evidence may lead to an ASM with a higher foetal risk profile being used extensively, prior to a full understanding of its risks.",
    "While a number of studies indicate a teratogenic risk from certain ASMs, there are conflicting results regarding the degree of risk and the types of malformations associated with specific ASMs.Data are slow to accumulate and an earlier version of this review (Weston 2016) found extremely limited data on ASMs with a decade or more of clinical use.Such a lack of evidence makes it di icult to counsel women about treatment choices before or during pregnancy.There is, therefore, a clear need for a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data to inform these decisions.Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) would provide the most reliable evidence about the e ects of ASMs in pregnancy, but are essentially precluded by ethical considerations and logistical challenges pertaining to study design, recruitment and interpretation.",
    "In view of this, we performed a systematic review of all available evidence including registry-based, prospective cohort studies, RCTs and epidemiological studies using routine health record databases.At the protocol stage, we decided not to include malformation case-control studies (e.g.Jentink 2010a; Jentink 2010b) due to the substantial di erences in the approach in these studies and how these methods compare to prospective observational cohort studies.This decision is discussed further in Overall completeness and applicability of evidence.This review is an update of two previous reviews (Adab 2004 ; Weston 2016).Evidence from this review, along with the related review by the same Cochrane team (Bromley 2014) , will aid the decisions that clinicians and women with epilepsy have to make about the treatment of epilepsy during the potential childbearing years.",
    "To assess the e ects of prenatal exposure to commonly prescribed ASMs on the prevalence of major congenital malformations in the child.",
    "This review examines the association between specific ASM exposures and the prevalence of major congenital malformations compared to the general population or unexposed pregnancies in women with epilepsy.It also compares the prevalence of specific major congenital malformations types across the ASM treatment groups.",
    "We considered the following types of studies.",
    "1. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs).These studies included women with epilepsy who were randomised to a particular ASM prior to conception.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy taking ASM monotherapy.2. Prospective observational cohort studies.These included consecutive participants whose clinical information was collected prior to the birth of the child.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy treated with ASM monotherapy.3. Registry studies.These involve the collection of data from a wide region, country or number of countries, and recruitment is o en based on self-referral or clinician-referral, leading to nonsequential case ascertainment.We considered both diseasebased registries (e.g.pregnancy and epilepsy registries) and industry-sponsored product registry datasets.Pregnant women",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews with epilepsy prescribed ASM monotherapy were recruited prospectively prior to childbirth. 4. Population-based routine health record datasets.These studies utilise data collected for routine health monitoring, administrative or reimbursement reasons for entire national populations or specific populations (e.g.medical insurance databases).Individual recruitment of participants is not required.The intervention group(s) comprised women with epilepsy taking ASM monotherapy.",
    "Pregnant women with epilepsy taking a single ASM of interest were eligible for the intervention group.",
    "Participants eligible for the comparator groups were:",
    " pregnant women with epilepsy taking an ASM;",
    " pregnant women with epilepsy taking no ASM; or  pregnant women who do not have epilepsy.",
    "We excluded studies reporting ASM use solely in pregnant women with other conditions (e.g.mood disorders, pain).We included studies involving women taking ASMs for epilepsy and other conditions if the non-epilepsy conditions accounted for 30% or less of the total treatment group.This percentage criterion was increased from the previous review to accommodate data from population healthcare datasets, which o en include a wider group of participant indications.",
    "Women with epilepsy who received any of the following ASMs as monotherapy: acetazolmide, brivaracetam, bromide, carbamazepine, cenobamate, clomethiazole, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, dimethyloxazolidinedione, eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, estazolam, felbamate, flunarizine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, lorazepam, magnesium sulphate, medazepam, methylphenobarbital, mephenytoin, meprobamate, methazolamide, methsuximide, methyloxazepam, midazolam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, oxcarbazepine, perampanel, phenobarbitone, phenytoin, primidone, pregabalin, remacemide, retigabine, rufinamide, sodium valproate, stiripentol, sulthiame, tiagabine, topiramate, trimethadione, trifluoromethoxy benzothiazole, valnoctamide, vigabatrin, or zonisamide.",
    "We used two separate types of comparator groups in this review, as currently there is no clear evidence regarding the reliability of combining data from these two di erent groups.The two comparator groups are:",
    " controls: women with a diagnosis of epilepsy who were not taking ASMs and women without epilepsy. comparator treatment: women with epilepsy treated with ASM monotherapy, evaluated in subgroup analyses to enable treatment comparisons.",
    "The proportion of children who present with any type of major congenital malformation (as defined by study authors).Major malformations are structural abnormalities of the body or organs present from birth and which require intervention (e.g., corrective surgery) or have a significant level of impact on the child's daily functioning (EUROCAT).",
    "The proportion of children who present with the following specific major congenital malformations by area of the body.",
    " Neural tube malformations.",
    " Cardiac malformations.",
    " Oro-facial cle /craniofacial malformation.",
    " Skeletal or limb malformations.",
    "We chose the above disorders because they are important major malformations associated with exposure to ASMs in utero, because these are the most prevalent congenital malformations in the general population (ref: https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/eurocat/eurocat-data/prevalence_en), and because of the availability of data within the included studies.When extracting data from included studies, we compiled a list of all the specified malformations.Author JCS, a clinical geneticist, then reviewed the list and classified the items into one of the four specific malformation categories.",
    "We did not impose any language restrictions in the search and, when necessary, we obtained translations of articles written in languages other than English.",
    "We reviewed conference abstracts from neurology meetings published from 2010 to 2022, including abstracts from the International League Against Epilepsy meetings (American Epilepsy Society, International Epilepsy Congress, European Congress on Epileptology, Asian and Oceanian Epilepsy Congress and Latin American Congress on Epilepsy) and Teratology meetings (Teratology Society and European Teratology Society).Where possible, we linked abstracts to published datasets or categorised them as awaiting classification.",
    "We cross-matched reference lists of original research and review articles to the studies generated from the electronic searches.",
    "We handsearched reference lists of recent review articles and contacted lead and corresponding authors in the area for any relevant unpublished material.",
    "Five authors (RB, JW, JG, KE, RMcG) reviewed the titles and abstracts of articles highlighted by the searches and removed studies that obviously did not meet the inclusion criteria.Four authors (RB, JW, KE, RMcG) used full-text reports to determine study eligibility.We discussed disagreements and sought the opinion of a third author (JG, CJ, RB), when necessary.Multiple reports from single studies are common in this field.To ensure that each cohort was represented only once in our analysis, therefore to avoid double-counting the population across papers of included studies, we linked studies by recruitment date and sought confirmation from authors whether reports referred to single study populations.Where this was unclear, we contacted study authors for clarification.",
    "Eight authors (RB, JW, NA, JG, AM, KE, RMcG, SK, CJ) undertook data extraction of the included studies.We used pre-standardised electronic data extraction forms that members of the review team piloted and then amended, where necessary.We then crosschecked data extraction.All entries into RevMan were also doublechecked.",
    "Due to the observational design of the majority of the studies, we utilised the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studiesof Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool which the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies Methods Group has developed (Sterne 2016).The ROBINS-I tool for assessing risk of bias examines bias in the domains of confounding, selection, treatment classification, missing data, measurement and reported results.ROBINS-I uses signalling questions on a four-point scale to determine level of bias in specific elements of biases for each of these domains.Overall domain bias ratings are then classed as low, moderate, serious, critical or no information.",
    "ROBINS-I was developed for treatment studies and not pharmacovigilance studies, where the person taking the medication (the mother) is not the same person in which the outcome can occur (the child).Therefore, ROBINS-I needed to be adapted for use in this review.The adaption was led by author RB with input from other authors.Important confounder and mediator variables were selected based on published evidence of an association both in the general population and specifically in investigations regarding in utero ASM exposure and congential malformation outcomes.See Appendix 6 for further information.",
    "Eight authors completed risk of bias ratings (RB, JW, NA, JG, AM, KE, SK, MBD).Each included study was reviewed by two independent raters and the opinion of a third author (RB) was sought where there were disagreements in the domain level ratings.For RCTs, we intended to use the original Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB1) (Higgins 2011 ).",
    "We intended, where applicable, to create Summary of findings tables for outcomes and to grade each outcome accordingly using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach (Guyatt 2008 ).However, we found GRADE to not be optimised for these types of data and using it would have led to di erential ratings across comparisons, depending on whether there was a di erence in MCM rate or not; thus, producing ratings of lower evidence confidence for comparisons with no di erence between the ASMs.Further work is required on GRADE and ROBINS-I to optimise them for pregnancy pharmacovigilance investigations.",
    "We considered that di erent study design types or comparator groups may lead to di erent outcome results and, therefore, we did not combine all data into a single meta-analysis containing mixed study types, groups of di erent ASMs and comparator groups.Meta-analyses were instead stratified by study type, by comparator group (e.g.women with epilepsy untreated and women without epilepsy and with no treatment), and by ASM versus ASM comparison.We computed pooled prevalences of malformations within AED (antiepileptic drug) groups (using fixede ect models, unless otherwise stated) and reported them at the beginning of each drug section.The primary and secondary outcomes are presented as risk ratios (RRs).We also computed risk di erences (RDs) using Review Manager (RevMan) to take into account studies with no reported events.We calculated these e ect estimates in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported them in the results section (Higgins 2011) .Where treatment e ects were reported from individual studies, we used the summary e ect measure that had been utilised by the study authors to report results from the study.In some cases, OR instead of RR was reported by individual study authors.",
    "The RR is a measure of relative e ect expressed as the ratio of the risk of an event in the two groups.If the 95% confidence interval includes the value of 1.00, this implies there is no di erence between the groups (i.e. a non-significant result).If the value of 1.00 lies outside the 95% confidence interval, this implies there is a di erence between the groups (i.e. a significant result).The RD is a measure of absolute e ect expressed as the di erence of the risk of an event in the two groups.If the 95% confidence interval contains the value of 0.00, this implies there is no di erence between the groups (i.e. both groups have the same risk).If the value of 0.00 lies outside the 95% confidence interval, this implies there is a di erence between the groups (i.e. a significant result).",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "The significance of the RR and RD may be di erent, as the RD takes into account comparisons where there were no events in either arm, whilst the other does not.Although the RR estimates are large in many comparisons, the corresponding risk di erence estimates are fairly small; but even a small increase in risk for a specific major malformation is clinically meaningful.In these cases, it would be up to the patient/clinician to interpret these risk estimates in the context of the adverse outcome and in relation to the potential benefits of treatment (e.g.seizure control).We did not account for multiple testing and the totality of the evidence for a particular exposure should be considered rather than the outcomes of a single comparison.Finally, we did not carry out any formal analysis of a dose-response relationship.We have taken any dose-response results reported directly from the study papers.",
    "Data published in studies are o en duplicated as they are updated, particularly in the case of the prospective pregnancy registries, which update their publications as the numbers of enrolled pregnancies increase.In such cases, we considered the latest time point as the 'primary' study for inclusion.In some cohorts, this meant that we used di erent publications for di erent ASMs.Further, there are studies that report combined data from a number of di erent registers (e.g.EURAP 2018; Samren 1997) which also report independently and routine health record studies with cohort overlap (e.g.UK Clinical Research Practice Database; UK Health Record THIN Register).Where the combined data reported provided greater numbers for a particular ASM comparison, it was included in the meta-analysis but, where individual initiatives had greater numbers for a specific comparison (e.g.ASM vs control group), we included the individual study data and provided a narrative report of the collaborative initiatives.We carefully examined data to ensure that we did not include them more than once in the analysis and that we did not omit any non-duplicated data.",
    "We contacted study authors to obtain missing statistics from included studies to input into the meta-analysis.We also investigated study reasons for missing data to determine if they were missing at random or not.",
    "We assessed clinical heterogeneity by examining the di erences in study characteristics in order to inform decisions regarding the combination of study data in meta-analysis.A priori hypotheses of sources of clinical heterogeneity included: type of population (regional, national or international, single or multicentre), loss to follow-up, maternal factors including age, duration of ASM treatment, family history of congenital malformation, lifestyle factors, monotherapy, socioeconomic status, type of epilepsy, use of other medications and years of education.Child factors included: age of assessment, sex, seizure exposure, length of follow-up and outcome measurement.",
    "Where applicable, we also assessed statistical heterogeneity by examining the I 2 statistic and a Chi 2 test, using the guidelines outlined in Higgins 2011 for interpreting the results.According to these guidelines, an I 2 statistic of 0% to 40% may not be important, 30% to 60% may indicate moderate heterogeneity, 50% to 90% may indicate substantial heterogeneity and 75% to 100% may indicate considerable heterogeneity.Therefore, for this review, we considered an I 2 statistic of more than 50% to indicate significant heterogeneity.The I 2 statistic was not applicable in comparisons where there was only a single study or when only one study contributed data to the analysis.When interpreting the Chi 2 test, a P value of less than 0.01 was considered to indicate significant heterogeneity.When we found statistical heterogeneity, we presented both fixed-e ect and random-e ects analyses to enable exploration of di erences.",
    "We included studies using the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials (ORBIT) classification system if we suspected selective outcome reporting bias.We requested all protocols from included study authors to enable comparison of outcomes of interest; however, we received very few responses, complicating our performance of this comparison.",
    "Our comprehensive search of multiple sources and data types, together with our requests for unpublished data or clarification from authors, minimised the risk of publication bias.",
    "We employed both fixed-e ect and random-e ects meta-analyses to synthesise the data.We presented the primary outcome (major congenital malformations) and the secondary outcome of specific malformations as a risk ratio (RR).Within certain comparisons, we have also presented the risk di erences (RD) for both primary outcome (overall malformation rate).In the event that we deemed meta-analysing inappropriate (e.g.presence of clinical heterogeneity), we applied a narrative form to the review, discussing all comparisons according to the findings presented within the studies.",
    "Comparisons carried out included:",
    "1. specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on major congenital malformations; 2. specific ASM monotherapy group versus controls on specific major congential malformation types; 3. specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on major congential malformations; 4. specific ASM monotherapy group versus specific ASM monotherapy group on specific major congential malformations.",
    "We stratified each comparison by control group, comparator group and study design to ensure appropriate combination of study data.For example, cases reported in a national pregnancy and epilepsy register may also be represented in epidemiological datasets of routine health data which covers the same region or a case in an administrative insurance database may also have been reported to a national epilepsy and pregnancy register and therefore data were not combined across these di erent data sources.",
    "Subgroup analysis was stratified by ASM and type of control or comparator group.When heterogeneity was present across outcomes, we carried out a random-e ects analysis.We examined di erences between analyses and reported the appropriate analysis.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "We adopted a cautious approach to combining data extracted from di erent types of study, and also where di erent comparator groups were included as outlined in Measures of treatment e ect.Additionally, we only included studies where over 70% of the cohort were women taking ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy.This was due to the heterogeneity around doses prescribed, across women taking ASMs for di erent conditions.This decision is supported by the findings of Hernandez Diaz and colleagues (US Medicaid Registers) who found that di erences in the dose of topiramate prescribed for women with epilepsy compared to women prescribed it for other conditions altered the risk of orofacial anomalies.",
    "In this review, we considered ASM use in during pregnancy in women with epilepsy and the major malformation rate in their exposed children (Figure 1 ).Comparisons were made across the di erent ASM treatments and to unexposed children.The outcomes are summarised in Table 1 along with Summary of findings 1, Summary of findings 2 for lamotrigine and levetiracetam and in Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 , and Table 5 for carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate and valproate, respectively.The data for other ASMs were too limited at this time for useful tables to be compiled.Relative risks and risk di erences are displayed in Table 6 ",
    "The Robins-I was adapted for use here to understand the risk of biases but is not yet optimised for pregnancy pharmacovigilance work and, therefore, caution is required in the interpretation of its ratings.It did, however, show that di erent methodological approaches have di erent patterns of biases and are therefore in part complimentary (Figure 2 ).Cohort studies with primary data collection, for example, tend to have lower risks of misclassification of treatment and standardised review of the congenital malformation outcome in the children (leading to low risk of bias ratings), yet they are at higher risk of bias for cohort selection.The use of routine health record data at a national population level does not have these selection risks, however.Stratification of the results by study type provides an internal validation for the results (Figure 3 ) and the evidence presented in this review should be considered more certain when the results of di erent comparisons are consistent across study types.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Malformations are rare outcomes and therefore larger groups are needed to reliably detect a higher risk of malformation in one group over another.Therefore, the certainty of the evidence is greater for medications such as VPA, carbamazepine (CBZ) and lamotrigine (LTG) where the numbers of children are higher within and across the comparisons.The available data were more moderate for levetiracetam (LEV), phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB) in certain comparisons.Care should be taken in the interpretation of comparisons where there were fewer than 1000 pregnancies.",
    "In this updated review, electronic searches identified 1067 additional publications; this was in addition to the 11,695 records previously detected in searches for an earlier version of this review (Weston 2016 ).We found two additional records through handsearching.Following the removal of duplicates, 12,296 abstracts were screened for inclusion in the review across the original and this update.We excluded 12,013 abstracts due to irrelevance, leaving 283 full texts (156 new for this update) to be assessed for eligibility.As the inclusion criteria had been extended to include studies using routine health records in this update, we re-evaluated search results from the last version for such studies and identified eight additional studies (14 papers).In total, we excluded 155 full-text papers where they did not meet the inclusion criteria.See Characteristics of excluded studies and Figure 1 for the study flow diagram.We ultimately included 49 studies (128 publications) in this review.Of these, 113 records and 45 studies contributed data to the meta-analyses, two studies had certain data included in the meta-analysis whilst other data were narratively reviewed.",
    "A total of 128 included full-text publications reported on the 49 independent studies included in this review, of which all but one were non-randomised studies.The high number of publications per study were from longitudinal research initiatives such as epilepsy and pregnancy registers which update their results periodically.These full texts were related to an included study, as they presented information on the same cohort of children but either at a di erent time point or on a related, but not included, outcome (i.e.obstetric or neurodevelopmental outcome).Reported outcomes for each ASM were taken from the most relevant publication within a series; therefore, malformation information for specific ASMs may come from di erent publications within a series.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "We excluded 42 studies (55 papers) from the review (Excluded studies).Several of these papers were not written in the English language and, therefore, were sent for translation and data extraction in order to determine the study design and methodology used.The most frequent reasons for exclusion, however, were absence of reported ASM monotherapy-specific malformation outcomes, retrospective study design, and case-control study design.Studies were also excluded where the maternal indication was not epilepsy in 70% or more of participants, or if a subgroup analysis was not provided for women with epilepsy indication.These decisions were made to limit the likely heterogeneity regarding doses of ASMs used across indications, as dose is a significant driver of higher malformation risk (Brent 2004 ).",
    "Robins-I ratings are displayed in Figure 2 .",
    "For bias in confounding, no studies were rated as low as no studies were comparable to a randomised controlled trial.",
    "For bias in selection, three studies were rated as low (Denmark Health Record Registers, Finland Health Record Registers, Norwegian Health Record Registers) as they represented national datasets and one study was rated as moderate (Sweden Health Record Registers).All cohort or pregnancy register studies were at risk of selection biases and therefore 37 studies were rated as serious ( ",
    "For bias in classification, 14 studies were rated as low ( ",
    "This domain was di icult to assess as, for most of the studies, no protocol was available (particularly for older studies) or contact with the authors could not be established ( ",

    "The meta-analyses included 17,964 ASM-exposed pregnancies from cohort studies and 7913 from routine health record studies; additional exposed pregnancies from the EURAP collaboration and other studies were reviewed narratively.Individual ASM prevalence of major malformation ranged from 2.0% to 9.8% for cohort study data and 3.6% to 9.7% for studies utilising routine health record data (Table 1 , Figure 3 ).Summary of findings 1 and Summary of findings 2 along with Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , Table 4 , Table 5 , Table 6 and Table 7 provide a summary of the meta-analysis results for all comparisons for risk of major malformation.This update has included the most recent study data, which strengthens the previously identified risk associations for older ASMs such as CBZ, PB and VPA, where the comparisons include large numbers of exposed pregnancies.For other ASMs, there are some di erences in the results across the comparisons, but the better powered comparisons demonstrate an increased risk for PHT and for an overall major malformation risk with CBZ and for TPM.",
    "Whilst CBZ, PB, PHT, TPM and VPA are associated with an increase in the risk of major malformation, the level of risk varies between the four ASMs.For example, CBZ showed a lower overall major malformation risk rate than PB and VPA, and a lower risk for specific major malformation types compared to some ASMs (e.g.PB or TPM).All ASMs, regardless of their own association with an increased risk, carried a lower risk than VPA-exposure which had the highest prevalence from both cohort (9.8%) and routine health record data (9.7%).LTG remains the lowest risk ASM with adequate cohort size (N => 4700 pregnancies from cohort studies and N = 2502 from routine health record studies).LTG does appear to have a dose e ect, as do CBZ, PB and VPA.The number of LEVexposed pregnancies remains more limited than LTG but, in direct comparison, there is currently no significant di erence between these two ASMs, and LEV-exposed children have a lower overall",

    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews major malformation risk than CBZ, VPA and PHT.TPM exposure was associated with a higher overall major malformation risk in comparison to LTG, but not other ASMs; this finding may be due to relatively small numbers of participants in the TPM studies and only a few malformation events.TPM exposure, however, was associated with higher specific risks of oro-facial, craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations in comparison to LTG, LEV, CBZ, but not in comparison to the two control groups; but specific major malformation data were limited for the control cohorts.",
    "There remains limited information for GBP, OXC, TPM and ZNS and other 'newer' medications.The evidence for each ASM monotherapy is summarised below.",
    "CBZ was the most frequently investigated ASM both in terms of the number of publications and the number of included pregnancies (over 8220).The pooled major malformation prevalence for CBZ was 4.7% (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.9) from cohort studies, 4.0% (95% CI 3.0 to 5.4) for routine health record studies and 2.9% (95% CI 2.9 to 5.4); these were relatively consistent with the 5.5% (95% CI 4.5 to 6.6) prevalence from EURAP 2018 (Figure 3 ).",
    "In comparison to both children born to women without epilepsy and children born to women with untreated epilepsy, pooled data from the cohort studies found that children exposed to CBZ in utero had an increased risk of having a major malformation, with the di erence in risk ranging from 1% to 2%, respectively.The findings from routine health record studies are more mixed.In the larger of the two comparisons, CBZ was significantly associated with a higher risk of a major malformation, which was consistent with the cohort study data.",
    "In comparison to unexposed control children (both groups), there was no specific malformation which was increased above the background rate provided by the control children.Data were limited in terms of the specific malformation risk, mainly due to the absence of control data from some large pregnancy and epilepsy registry studies (e.g.North American Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register; UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register) and reporting of this level of detail from the population datasets (e.g.Denmark Health Record Registers; UK Clinical Research Practice Database; UK Health Record THIN Register).This likely contributed to the non-significant outcomes found for neural tube malformations, which has been an association found by others using di erent methodologies (Jentink 2010b ).",
    "Data from the cohort studies were more numerous for CBZ-exposed pregnancies compared to other monotherapy ASMs.There was a higher risk of major malformation in comparison to children exposed to LEV or LTG in comparisons which included over 500 pregnancies in each arm, with the risk being 1% higher.However, comparisons at the specific malformation level were not significant; this was likely due to fewer data being available at this level of investigation.The increased risk observed in data from cohort studies was not replicated in studies using databases containing routine health records, however, patient/ event numbers in the databases were smaller than the pooled experience from cohort studies.",
    "Despite its associated higher risk, CBZ exposure was associated with a lower level of risk than VPA exposure, with a 5% di erence in overall major malformation risk and a lower risk across neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial and skeletal/limb malformations.Further, while CBZ is comparable to the increased risk from PB, PHT or TPM in data from cohort studies for overall major malformation, the specific malformation risk varied.The association of CBZ exposure with cardiac malformations was lower in comparison to PB or to PHT exposure and lower for skeletal/limb or oro-facial/craniofacial malformation risk when compared to TPM exposure.",
    "There was no significant increase in risk in comparison to OXC, GBP, PRM or CZP exposure from both cohort and health record studies, but data were more limited for these comparator ASMs currently and caution is required.",
    "Dose is a key feature of teratogenic malformation risk (Brent 2004 ).Data from EURAP 2018 is the most reliable to investigate dose associations due to its large number of CBZ-exposed pregnancies and its low risk of bias on the domain of outcome measurement.It demonstrates a dose-related risk for CBZ with doses over 700 mg/d carrying a higher risk, although even their lower dose group had a high level of risk in comparison to children exposed to LTG (EURAP 2018).",
    "Data relating to the use of monotherapy clonazepam during pregnancy and child major malformation risk is substantially limited with fewer than 150 pregnancies reported across both cohort and routine health record studies.The generated prevalence reported here was 2.1% (95% CI 0.2 to 17.3%) to 2.5% (95% CI 0.0 to 131.8) but the confidence intervals were very wide, due to the limited data.When compared to other ASMs, however, a lower risk was identified in comparison to VPA exposure, with a risk di erence of 9%.Due to the current limited data available, no firm conclusion can be made currently whether CZP is associated with an increased risk in comparison to control children.",
    "Experience with GBP exposure in pregnancy was also limited.",
    "Outcomes from only 210 reported pregnancies could be included in our meta-analysis.The pooled prevalence of major malformation was 2.0% (95% CI 0.1 to 32.2) from cohort studies, with too few data being available from studies using routine health records to provide a pooled prevalence rate.We found no di erence between the children exposed to GBP compared with either type of control group, but caution is warranted due to limited numbers.Data which could not be included in meta-analysis, from the US Medicaid Registers, found that children exposed to GBP (N = 347) for the indication of maternal epilepsy were not at a greater risk of major malformation, which matched the wider finding from 3745 GBP-exposed pregnancies (any indication).Whilst this study may o er reassurance, caution is required as the indications were not predominantly epilepsy and, therefore, there may be di erences in typically prescribed doses; replication of this finding is also required in another adequately powered cohort.",
    "We found no di erence in overall major malformation rate or in the specific malformations investigated for the children exposed to GBP compared to CBZ, LTG, LEV, OXC, PHT, PB, TPM and ZNS, but there was a very limited number of GBP-exposed children.",
    "In comparison to the children exposed to VPA, children exposed",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to GBP in utero had a significantly lower risk (8%) of having a malformation than children exposed to VPA, but data were too limited to investigate specific malformation di erences.",
    "Data for GBP dose and malformation rate were limited from cohort studies but data from the US Medicaid Registers failed to find an association between higher doses of GBP and a higher risk of malformation.However, the vast majority of women taking GBP were doing so for conditions other than epilepsy and, therefore, caution is warranted.",
    "The use of LTG has increased over the last decade in women of childbearing age (Ackers 2009; Man 2012; Wen 2015).The pooled prevalence of major malformation for LTG was 2.7% (95% CI 1.9 to 3.8%) from cohort studies, 3.5% (95% CI 2.5 to 4.9) from routine health record studies, and 2.9% (95% CI 2.3 to 3.7) from the EURAP 2018 collaboration.Most of the evidence indicated no di erence in the overall major malformation rate between the children exposed to LTG and either type of control group.However, in comparison to children born to women without epilepsy, there was a significant di erence from the pooled cohort data, with the risk being increased by 1% for the children exposed to LTG.Whilst levels of heterogeneity were not increased overall, one study had a much higher rate of malformation in the LTG group.Further, a larger LTG-exposed group was available for comparison to the women with epilepsy who were not treated, which showed the LTG major malformation risk was not significantly di erent from the control children for overall malformation rate or for the specific malformation types investigated; this was consistent with the non-significant finding from the routine health record studies in comparison to both control groups.Further, no increase in specific malformation types were identified, and data from the US Medicaid Registers failed to find an association with oral cle malformations in over 2000 LTG-exposed children in comparison to control children who were not exposed to ASMs.",
    "In comparison to LEV, which has also seen a significant increase in use in women of childbearing age in a lot of countries (Meador 2009; Wen 2015), there were no significant di erences for LTG in either the overall major malformation rate or the specific malformation types investigated.Children exposed to LTG also did not di er either in terms of overall major malformation rate or in terms of specific malformations compared with children exposed to OXC, CZP, GBP and ZNS; however, data were limited for all of these comparisons due to small numbers of OXC, CZP, GBP and ZNSexposed pregnancies.",
    "The children exposed to LTG were at a significantly lower risk of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, PB, PHT and TPM exposures (see results for specific risk levels) in cohort study data.Routine health record studies did not replicate this, however, were limited in terms of numbers of included LTG-exposed pregnancies in comparison to PB, PHT and TPM and, therefore, were perceived as less reliable.Analyses of cohort study data showed that, at the specific malformation level, children exposed to LTG were at a lower risk of cardiac malformations in comparison to PB and PHT exposures and fewer skeletal malformations than children exposed to TPM and PHT.This latter finding was also observed in the large cohort from the US Medicaid Registers.Finally, children exposed to LTG had a threefold lower risk of overall major malformation when compared to the children exposed to VPA, with a risk di erence showing that the significant reduction in risk was 6% for children exposed to LTG.Neural tube, cardiac, oro-facial cle , craniofacial, skeletal and limb malformations were all significantly lower for the LTG-exposed children.",
    "The large, well-designed EURAP 2018 study has demonstrated a dose relationship between LTG treatment and major malformation risk, with exposures to LTG ≤ 325 mg/d associated with the lowest malformation prevalence.Other studies did not find a dose relationship, however, the EURAP 2018 collaboration is by far the largest and most standardised in their assessment of the malformation, comprising of participants from 42 countries (N = 2514).Therefore, higher doses of LTG may be associated with higher levels of risk and this should be considered when prescribing doses over 325 mg/d.It is possible that this dose association may account, at least in part, for the variation seen in the outcome in one of the control comparisons.",
    "The frequency of data and the number of included pregnancies exposed to LEV were more limited than for CBZ, LTG or VPA.There were 1242 LEV-exposed pregnancies included from cohort data across all comparisons and just 248 from studies employing routine health record data currently.This delay is likely due in part to the time it takes for adequate numbers of women taking newer ASMs to accumulate, however, it undermines counselling for a now commonly established medication (Meador 2009; Wen 2015).",
    "The pooled prevalence for major malformation occurrences following LEV-exposure was 2.6% (95% CI 1.6 to 4.4) for cohort study data, 2.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 321.9) for routine health record study data (which had large confidence intervals) and 2.8% (95% CI 1.7 to 4.5) from EURAP 2018.There was no significant di erence between the children exposed to LEV and control children in the meta-analysis for overall major malformation rate; these comparisons also both contained > 1000 pregnancies in each arm.Data pertaining to specific malformation types in comparison to control children were limited, however, and it is not possible to draw conclusions until more data are available.",
    "In comparison to other ASM treatments, children exposed to LEV were not significantly di erent from children exposed to LTG in terms of overall major malformation prevalence or the specific malformation types investigated.In addition, we found no significant di erence between children exposed to LEV compared with those exposed to GBP, OXC, CZP, TPM ZNS or PRM, although data within these comparisons were somewhat limited.Children exposed to LEV had a lower overall MCM rate than the children exposed to CBZ, PB and PHT exposures, but there was no di erence in terms of the specific malformation types investigated.While the overall major malformation risk was not significantly di erent for the children exposed to LEV versus those exposed to TPM, the children exposed to LEV were at lower risk of having an orofacial/craniofacial, skeletal or limb malformation in comparison to the TPM-exposed children.Additionally, children exposed to LEV had a lower specific risk of developing a cardiac malformation in comparison to PB-exposed children.Finally, the children exposed to LEV had a 7 to 8% lower risk of overall malformations compared with the children exposed to VPA, with a lower risk identified for all investigated specific types of malformations for the children exposed to LEV.Caution is required, therefore, regarding the malformation risk with above average doses of LEV, until more data are available.",
    "Data for pregnancy outcomes following exposure to OXC were limited to just under 400 pregnancies in cohort studies and 507 pregnancies from routine health record studies.The prevalence of major malformation was 2.8% (95% CI 1.1 to 6.6) versus 4.8% (95% CI 0.7 to 31.5) with routine health record studies containing more OXC-exposed pregnancies across comparisons.The prevalence reported from EURAP 2018 for 333 OXC monotherapy-exposed pregnancies was 3.0% (95% CI 1.4 to 5.4).",
    "In comparison to control children, the pooled routine health record study data found no elevated risk for OXC exposure in comparison to controls; these results were similar in the cohort study data.",
    "Given the numbers of included OXC-exposed pregnancies across both study types, further research is required for conclusions to be drawn in regard to OXC exposure and major malformation outcome.While limited comparisons to other ASMs could be made, where evidence was available, there was no significant di erence between the overall major malformation rate or the specific malformations investigated compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, LEV, LTG, GBP, PHT, PB, TPM, PRM and ZNS.Children exposed to OXC were at a significantly lower risk of having an major malformation of any type compared with children exposed to VPA, with the risk di erence being 4 to 6% depending on the study type.There were very limited data pertaining to specific malformation types, and caution is required.",
    "Only EURAP 2018 reported dose and malformation rates for OXCexposed pregnancies.Whilst they did not compare lower versus higher OXC dose, they did report that certain dose levels of OXC were comparable to lower-dose LTG.More studies of OXC-exposed pregnancies are required, however, before it is determined whether a higher level of OXC dose carries a higher malformation risk.",
    "Despite years of use, data from prospective studies investigating PB as monotherapy were surprisingly limited, with only 840 monotherapy-exposed pregnancies across the di erent comparisons and study types.The data pooled from included studies generated a major malformation prevalence of 6.3% (95% CI 4.8 to 8.3) from cohort studies and 8.8% (95% CI 0.0 to 9722.4) from routine health record studies; the latter was limited in cohort size and the prevalence should be interpreted with caution.There was a prevalence of 6.5% (95% CI 4.2 to 9.9) from EURAP 2018.",
    "The results regarding PB-exposure in comparison to control children demonstrated variable results.We found a significantly increased risk of overall major malformation compared with children born to women without epilepsy, with a risk di erence of 4%.However, we found no significant di erence compared with children born to women without epilepsy.However, both comparisons included under 500 PB-exposed pregnancies, which may account for the unstable pattern of the findings.Routine health record data studies included too few PB-exposed pregnancies at this time to provide reliable estimates.Data pertaining to specific malformations were extremely limited or missing and likely contributed to the non-significant di erences found for PB in comparison to the control children.This is certainly the case for cardiac malformations, where rates of cardiac malformations are increased in comparison to numerous other ASMs exposures.",
    "In comparison to other ASMs, children exposed to PB were not at a significantly increased rate of overall major malformation compared with children exposed to CBZ, CZP, GBP, PHT, OXC, TPM, PRM, LEV and ZNS exposures; but the comparison to CBZ exposure was the only one where the PB-exposed group had over 500 pregnancies.PB exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of oro-facial cle s and craniofacial malformations when compared to LEV or LTG exposures.Children exposed to PB had a higher overall major malformation than the children exposed to LTG, but a lower risk compared with the children exposed to VPA, with the risk being 4% lower.Therefore, despite both PB and VPA being associated with an increased risk of being born with an major malformation, the risk associated with VPA is significantly higher, including for cardiac malformations.",
    "The majority of studies did not investigate or report on a potential relationship between dose of PB and major malformation risk, due to limited included pregnancies.A dose-mediated risk was also apparent for cardiac malformations, with the prevalence increasing from 1% to 8% for doses < 150 mg/d and those ≥ 150 mg/d, respectively (EURAP 2018).Samren 1997 also found a dose e ect for PB.Given the size of the EURAP 2018 cohort and their standardised approach to reviewing, it is concluded that there is likely a strong dose relationship for PB.",

    "E orts were made to ensure that the evidence presented here was as complete as possible by including the two dominant research study designs for this area of research; cohort study designs and datasets which contain routinely collected health records.However, we did not include case-control congenital anomaly registers.In these registers, children are enrolled when the presence or absence of a malformation is known and, therefore, we classified recruitment as retrospective (e.g.Jentink 2010a; Jentink 2010b).Further, the nature of this data meant that it could not be directly combined into meta-analysis with the data from the prospective observational studies.Additionally, in order to make the results of this review applicable to the treatment of women with epilepsy, included studies were required to include 70% or greater proportions of women taking ASMs for the treatment of epilepsy.This, however, will have reduced the sample size and may not be necessary.Whilst Christensen and colleagues (Denmark Health Record Registers) in 2021 found no di erence in risk estimates in the children of women with epilepsy in comparison to the children born to women with other indications, Hernandez Diaz and colleagues, using US Medicaid Registers, derived data found that, in the context of TPM, the indication did alter the outcome reported.Further investigations are required to answer whether limiting this review to a high proportion of women with epilepsy is required.",
    "E orts were made to ensure that the most up-to-date information from the longitudinal research initiatives was utilised, which meant that we o en had to take outcomes for di erent ASMs from a number of di erent papers, or that authors investigated malformation types separately over di erent papers, or published updates for certain ASMs only.The largest challenge in terms of the completeness of the evidence came from some studies not reporting specific monotherapy outcomes or reporting monotherapy and polytherapy outcomes for a particular ASM together (e.g.Richmond 2004; Sabers 2004).However, this appeared to be a more frequent finding with older studies and there was a noticeable trend regarding separate reporting for each ASM for monotherapy exposures.",
    "The final challenge to the completeness of the data was in regard to the risk of specific types of malformations, due in a large part to the failure of included studies to publish specific malformation outcomes for all included groups.Whilst this is undoubtedly due to publication space, providing such information is critical for understanding the risks associated with specific malformation types.As demonstrated, in the case of PB or TPM, an ASM exposure may be associated with specific malformations, so reporting only an overall malformation figure may mask important associations.Further, unclear reporting and di erences in the defining of certain malformation types or groups meant that we could not investigate",

    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews hypospadias or gastrointestinal malformations, which have been linked to certain ASM exposures (EURAP 2018; Sweden Health Record Registers).",
    "A few points of heterogeneity were found between included studies, which may limit the completeness of the evidence.Studies varied in how they dealt with the inclusion of foetal deaths or interruptions of pregnancy (with and without malformations) and in whether they counted genetic causes of malformation in their overall prevalence.At the outset of this review, we decided to use the author-defined major malformation rate, as the review authors would be unlikely to have all the data required to determine information about reported major malformations.Considering this, however, we cannot confirm that all the studies applied the same criteria for classifying a major malformation.Further, there were di erences between studies in the time at which the outcome was reported.For example, the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register has a major malformation reporting time before three months of age, whilst others included malformation presence at birth (e.g.Bozhinov 2009).Data from the EURAP 2018 collaboration and by Christensen and colleagues (2021) using Denmark Health Record Registers demonstrates that the reviewing of major malformation outcome at 12 months of age leads to an increased detection and, therefore, higher prevalence.Thus, data reported from some studies may in fact be an underestimation of the prevalence of major malformation if the assessment of the child occurs prior to 12 months of age.",
    "Finally, major malformation risk is not the only outcome of importance in pregnancy exposures.Beyond the scope of this review, small-for-gestational-age, prematurity, minor congential malformations as well as longer-term child health and neurodevelopmental outcomes can be altered, with life impacting consequences (Bromley 2014 ; Clayton-Smith 2019; Dean 2000) and, therefore, require consideration when understanding the total impact of an ASM exposure on the developing child.Minor malformations, for example, are an important part of the diagnostic criteria for foetal anticonvulsant syndromes, in particular (Clayton-Smith 2019; Dean 2000) and their presence may lead to a more detailed physical examination to check for more severe physical symptoms of exposure or neurodevelopmental impairment.",
    "Neurodevelopmental impairments are also a more commonly occurring outcome in the general population and, therefore, will occur more frequently in the ASM-exposed populations and can have a significant impact on quality of life (Bromley 2014; Clayton-Smith 2019).",
    "Strengths of this review update include the creation and advance publication of the review protocol, the clear inclusion criteria, extensive searches, the acquisition of unpublished data, the inclusion of articles not written in English, meta-analysis for all possible comparisons, the consideration of specific as well as overall major malformation risk, the balance of both systematic reviewing and content expertise and the assessment of risk of bias and quality in the non-randomised evidence.Further, we improved the quality of the meta-analyses by stratifying by type of control group and importantly study design.The results across the di erent study types were summarised in meta-analysis separately due to the potential overlap in the cases (e.g. a national epilepsy and pregnancy register may contain the same children with a malformation as a population dataset which utilised routine health records for that same region or population).Further, at the start of this review, there were concerns about likely heterogeneity coming from di erent measurement approaches, periods of follow-up and di erent patterns of maternal indications.However, in comparisons with larger numbers of included exposed pregnancies, the prevalences were similar (Table 1 , Figure 3 ).We therefore take the view that cohort studies and studies utilising population level health records o er complimentary evidence which can be viewed as replicating the results of each other, to ensure evidence consistency across the total available data.",
    "Under the Cochrane guidelines, this review will continue to be updated every two years, or following the publication of a significant amount of new data, to ensure it remains up-to-date which adds further strength.",
    "The methodological quality for each individual study is displayed in the Risk of bias in included studies and in Figure 2 . Randomised controlled trials are thought to be unethical in this area due to the permanence of potential adverse e ects for the foetus.Gold standard evidence for this area would, therefore, comprise data coming from a recruitment approach with low selection bias, prospective follow-up, blinded outcome assessment to a standardised protocol and statistical methods to limit the influence of confounding or mediating variables.Obtaining all of these features in a single study is di icult and di erent study designs have a di erent set of strengths and weaknesses.",
    "The RoB ratings provided by an adaption of ROBINS-I, for example, showed that the certain routine health record studies scored at a lower risk of bias than the cohort studies for risk of selection biases, yet the routine health record studies were at higher risk for outcome measurement which was completed in a nonstandardised manner by clinicians who were not blinded to the ASM exposure of the child.To balance these strengths and weaknesses which are inherent within these study designs, a complimentary set of pharmacovigilance approaches are required in order to have an accurate understanding of the data pertaining to possible risk associated with ASM exposures.",
    "It should be considered that ROBINS-I is not optimised for pregnancy pharmacovigilance studies where the person taking the medication (mother) is not the person in which the outcome in is being assessed (child) and it was challenging to adopt the signalling questions and ratings to function for this review.Further, the recommended GRADE framework for rating the certainty of evidence was not used, as it would produce di erential ratings depending on whether there were di erences between the medications or not.For reviews of pregnancy pharmacovigilance data, bespoke risk of bias and certainty of evidence tools are required.",
    "In conclusion, our risk of bias review indicates that, across the included studies, there are a number of important biases assessed as high risk which should be taken into account when interpreting the results.The biases, however, were thought to be balanced across the ASMs investigated and, therefore, it is not felt that the findings were due solely to these biases.",
    "Despite many review articles in this area, there are few systematic reviews where meta-analysis has been conducted and, where they have been completed, there are variations in study methodology (i.e.inclusion criteria).For example, the reviews by Veroniki 2017 and Meador 2008, included both prospective and retrospective studies, studies using population-based electronic healthcare records, and data from case-control studies.Whilst such a wide inclusion criteria led to increased numbers of included pregnancies within the meta-analysis, the comparability of data from these di erent methodological types is unclear.Charlton 2008, for example, had demonstrated di erent rates of malformations from the UK Clinical Research Practice Database in comparison to the UK and Ireland Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register.Further, combining data from population studies using healthcare records with national epilepsy and pregnancy registers may lead to cases being represented twice; which, for rare outcomes, could alter the analyses significantly.We took a more cautious approach and did not combine data from cohort studies with data from studies that used population-level routine health records.Whilst our findings were comparable to the more recent Veroniki 2017 review in regard to VPA, PTM, PB, PHT, and CBZ, we did not have enough data to investigate their finding that ethosuximide is associated with an increased risk of major malformation.Overall, our approach of reviewing and undertaking meta-analysis separately for primary and secondary data sources provides internal comparison and validation of the results which, we feel, is a strength.",
    "Further consistent findings were reported by Jentink 2010b who found the prevalence of malformation following CBZ to be 3.3% based on 2680 CBZ children from eight studies.In contrast to our review, however, Jentink 2010b found a significant association between CBZ exposure and spina bifida.However, as in our review, Jentink 2010a found that eight studies (N = 1565 pregnancies) showed a prevalence rate of 7.5% (95% CI 6.3 to 9.0) in those exposed to VPA, and noted an increase in terms of specific malformations.The data reported here pertaining to LEV is consistent with a previous systematic review (Chaudhry 2014) This updated meta-analysis did not consistently replicate the reported association between TPM exposure and oral cle s, but we did narratively review data from the large US Medicaid Registers study, which reported an association.In a previously completed meta-analysis, Alsaad 2015 had wider inclusion criteria which included 3420 patients taking TPM (mixed aetiologies and study design types) and 1,204,981 controls and reported a significant odds ratio (OR 6.26, 95% CI: 3.13 to 12.51).As noted throughout this discussion, data were limited pertaining to the newer ASMs and by the reporting of specific malformations in included studies, therefore, it is possible that the limited data that contributed to this meta-analysis do not consistently uphold this association across all comparisons.",
    "There is an obvious delay between the approval of a medication for use and obtaining comprehensive evidence regarding the potential major malformation risk.Some delay is inevitable, however, a longer delay than necessary will limit evidencebased decision-making regarding optimising the treatment of maternal epilepsy whilst limiting potential foetal risk.A failure to document the first few years' worth of pregnancies to women on newer medications delays knowledge acquisition and new ASMs use in women of childbearing age may be unnecessarily avoided for longer than required.There are numerous medications approved for the treatment of epilepsy around the world, yet we see many without data at this time.The emergence of population level datasets using routine health record databases will likely have a positive impact on this latency, due to their automatic inclusion of large populations (Denmark Health Record Registers).Whilst low in participation selection bias, utilising routine healthcare data has reduced measurement sensitivity though, and disease pregnancy and epilepsy registers or clinical studies which employ blinded, standardised review of the malformation outcome o er a more sensitive approach to outcome measurement.The pharmacovigilance strategy for the ASMs, therefore, should actively include di erent study designs which balance each other's methodological areas of strength and weakness to form a reliable and comprehensive evidence base.",
    "The RoB ratings highlight the issue that within-study methodological improvements are required.Few studies, for example, report on how the major malformation was assessed and determined to be major or minor and whether this was done blinded to the ASM history, despite this being the primary study outcome.Therefore, an easily adopted improvement for research is to encourage the use of blinded, standardised assessments of the physical outcomes and use standardised classification approaches, such as those used by clinical geneticists, including the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (http:// human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/about.html)to allow for more accurate comparison across studies.",
    "Whilst research methodologies have become more refined over the years, for example, by reporting individual ASM types, rather than a single monotherapy group or recognising the importance of ASM dose, there are still several limitations in the approach to data reporting.The provision of an overall major malformation risk figure, for example, is unlikely to be reliable, as demonstrated for PB and TPM, and future data collection and analysis should implement automatic reporting at the specific malformation level, including this as supplementary information.To improve the data at this finer level, initiatives will require large cohorts and, therefore, there should be a movement towards standardised protocols and procedural alignment across research initiatives to allow for large enough datasets regarding specific malformation types for specific ASMs and specific doses.",
    "Further investigations are also required into the factors which may modify the major malformation risk.This includes further consideration regarding folate supplementation and regarding the optimal dose for women with epilepsy.As cohorts increase in size, more nuanced investigations into dose associations are required by specific malformation types and future work should also consider any family risk factors.Observations have shown that some women who take ASMs, even at a very low dose, appear to be at higher risk of having a child with an ASM-associated malformation.Further research focusing on identification of genomic variants which might modify how di erent women metabolise ASMs is crucial so that those who may be at higher risk of having a child with a major malformation, even when taking a lower dose of a specific ASM, can be identified and ASM treatment selected accordingly.Whilst this has proven di icult in the past, whole exome/genome sequencing, with careful selection of individuals for testing, is likely to make this more achievable (Ku 2011 ).",
    "Finally, longitudinal work which also investigates the longerterm health outcomes of children with ASM exposures should be undertaken to understand the true impact.Where possible, research initiatives which recruit pregnant women with epilepsy for the purpose of investigating major malformation outcomes should also seek to, where possible, utilise these populations to understand child health and neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

    "The authors reviewed the Robins-I framework and adpated it for use in this context.The original framework and the signalling questions were reviewed for suitability for classifying quality.Key confounder and mediating variables were determined based on a literature search and author knowledge.The wording of each of the signalling questions was adapted to reflect the issue of exposure to a medication.The criteria for each of the ratings was set by the authors and trialed on three included papers.This framework is available on request from the authors.",
    "RB led the writing of this version of the review with input from SK, MBD, KE, RMcG, R.H, CJ, NA, JG, AJM, CT, JCS, JC, and AM.Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken by RB, JP, CJ, NA, JCS, AJM, SK,MBD, KE, RMcG.JCS assisted extensively with the classification of malformations within this review.",
    "RB's institution has received consultancy fees from UCB Pharma on one occasion due to work undertaken by RB.NA has been sponsored to attend educational meetings and conferences in epilepsy over the last five years by UCB Pharma, GSK and Boehringer Ingelheim, and has participated in regional advisory Board meetings for Eisai on their product eslicarbazepine and zonisamide.AM leads the National Audit of Seizure Management in Hospitals (NASH), which is funded via a grant from UCB Pharma paid to the University of Liverpool.He has also given lectures at educational events sponsored by Sanofi and GSK, with honoraria paid to University of Liverpool.Professor Tony Marson is Theme Leader for Managing Complex Needs at NIHR CLAHRC NWC and an NIHR Senior Investigator.No other conflicts of interest were declared.",
    "Firstly, in accordance with the protocol (Pulman 2012) , in the first (Adab 2004 ) and second versions (Weston 2016 ) of this review, where possible, we conducted meta-analysis at the monotherapy group level.However, given the clear di erentiated pattern of risk for specific ASMs in the previous version of the review, we considered that this approach was no longer reliable and could lead to a misrepresentation of the evidence.Therefore, the inclusion criteria for this review were altered at the current update to report outcomes for specific monotherapy ASM types only and not a group of heterogeneous monotherapy exposures.Secondly, in the original protocol, we stated that we would also review outcomes by polytherapy combinations, however, given the already numerous comparisons of monotherapies included in this review, outcomes by polytherapy combinations was not feasible here.A separate piece of work is required to delineate the very limited data currently available for specific polytherapy combinations and infant major congenital malformation outcomes.Thirdly, in the protocol, it was stated that we would look at the specific malformations of a genitourinary and gastrointestinal nature, however, at the point of data extraction, it became apparent that grouping of malformations into this classification was too heterogeneous to do in a way which was worthwhile.A er consideration of the included studies, the four most commonly reported specific malformation types were selected and reported on.This will be considered again at the next update.Finally, due to the small amount of data pertaining to minor malformations identified from the published literature in the second version of this review (Weston 2016), minor malformations were not included in the updated version of the review."
