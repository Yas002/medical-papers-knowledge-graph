    "Bladder dysfunction is a common complication following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic floor fasciae.Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, and patient dissatisfaction.In addition, bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL).Several postoperative interventions have been proposed to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.To our knowledge, there has been no systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of these interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with cervical cancer.",
    "To evaluate the e ectiveness and safety of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer (stage IA2 to IIA2).",
    "We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2020, Issue 4) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE via Ovid (1946 to April week 2, 2020), and Embase via Ovid (1980 Ovid ( to 2020, week 16, week 16 ).We also checked registers of clinical trials, grey literature, conference reports, and citation lists of included studies.",
    "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of any type of postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction following a radical hysterectomy in women with stage IA2 to IIA2 cervical cancer.",
    "Two review authors independently selected potentially relevant RCTs, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, compared results, and made judgments on the quality and certainty of the evidence.We resolved any disagreements through discussion or consultation with a third review author.Outcomes of interest consisted of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er the operation, quality of life (QoL), adverse events, post-void residual urine volume one month a er the operation, urinary tract infection over the one month following the operation, and subjective urinary symptoms.",
    "None of the included studies reported rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual volume of urine of 50 mL or less, or post-void residual urine volume at 6 and 12 months a er surgery, all of which are important outcomes for assessing postoperative bladder dysfunction.",
    "Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by lowering postvoid residual urine volume.The certainty of this evidence, however, was very low.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation) remain unproven.",
    "The issue Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus (womb) with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) is the treatment for early-stage cervical cancer (when cancer is still within the cervix and upper vagina, without spread into nearby tissues).Bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) is a common problem following radical hysterectomy, caused by the damage to the nerves controlling urination.",
    "To assess the usefulness and safety of treatment to prevent bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.We searched the scientific databases for randomised controlled trials (studies in which people or groups of people are allocated by chance to two or more groups, treating them di erently) published to April 2020.",
    "We found four studies that met the inclusion criteria.One study compared a medication called bethanechol to placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic e ect, used as a control in testing drugs).Three studies compared suprapubic catheterisation (insertion of a flexible tube (catheter) into the bladder through a cut in the lower abdomen to drain urine) with intermittent self-catheterisation (insertion of a catheter via the urethra, into the bladder at intervals throughout the day).",
    "Bethanecol may reduce the chance of bladder dysfunction by lowering the volume of post-void residual urine, assessed at one month a er surgery.However, the certainty of this evidence is very low and further studies have the potential to better inform this outcome.*The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI).CI: confidence interval; MD: mean difference; RR: risk ratio GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect a The evidence was downgraded by two levels due to serious imprecision (small sample size and wide CI crossing the line of no e ect).",
    "b The evidence was downgraded by one level due to indirectness (reporting adverse events of unclear severity and unclear their association with the intervention).c The evidence was downgraded by one level due to unclear risk of selection bias.",

    "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer a ecting women worldwide, with an estimated 569,847 new cases and 311,365 cervical cancer-related deaths globally in 2018 (Bray 2018) .Cervical cancer is a major health problem among women in developing countries, with almost 70% of the global burden and 90% of cervical cancer-related deaths occurring in these regions (Ferlay 2015; Bray 2018) .The high burden of cervical cancer among less economically developed settings is secondary to the failure to provide e ective, large-scale screening programmes (Torre 2015; Bray 2018).",
    "Treatment of cervical cancer depends on the extent of the disease.Appendix 2 displays a 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer (Bhatla 2019) , which was revised from the 2009 FIGO staging system (Appendix 3).Women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO stage IA2 to IIA2) can be treated with either radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy (removal of the uterus with its surrounding tissues and lymph glands in the pelvis) or pelvic chemoradiation (radiation therapy to lower abdomen being given at the same time as chemotherapy) (Landoni 1997) .In premenopausal women, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy may be preferable to pelvic radiation in order to preserve ovarian function and vaginal elasticity, as well as prevent the long-term risks of pelvic radiation (Cull 1993; Viswanathan 2014) .",
    "The aim of radical hysterectomy is to remove the primary tumour with an adequate margin of normal tissue to ensure complete resection (Piver 1974; Querleu 2008; Verleye 2009) .Appendix 4 lists details of the three systems for the classification of radical hysterectomy (Piver-Rutledge-Smith, Gynecological Cancer Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and Querleu and Morrow).The stage of cervical cancer is the fundamental factor to be taken into consideration when considering radical hysterectomy.Women with early-stage cervical cancer are traditionally treated with Piver type III radical hysterectomy.However, a previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated that women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent Piver type II hysterectomy (also called modified radical hysterectomy) had comparable oncological outcomes to those who underwent type III hysterectomy (Landoni 2001) .Pelvic lymphadenectomy is performed to look for metastatic lesions in the pelvic lymph nodes.The survival of women with earlystage cervical cancer who undergo radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is excellent.Estimated five-year survival rates range between 70% and 90% (Kim 2000; Suprasert 2010; Srisomboon 2011; Mahawerawat 2013) .",
    "One of the most distressing morbidities that can occur following radical hysterectomy is bladder dysfunction (problems with the way the bladder holds and releases urine) (Lin 1998; Plotti 2011; Laterza 2015) .The incidence of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy varies from 12% to 85% depending on the method used in evaluating bladder dysfunction and the duration of follow-up (Zullo 2003; Wit 2014) .In addition, the risk of bladder dysfunction depends on the extent of surgery.Women undergoing type II radical hysterectomy are at lower risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction than those who undergo type III radical hysterectomy (Landoni 2001; Raspagliesi 2006) .By magnifying anatomical structures in the pelvis, laparoscopic approaches may help reduce the denervation of pelvic nerves during radical hysterectomy.However, it has yet to be shown that these approaches have a significant e ect on the prevention of bladder dysfunction (Laterza 2015; Kietpeerakool 2019) .Minimally invasive radical hysterectomy, however, is associated with inferior survival to laparotomy radical hysterectomy in women with earlystage cervical cancer.Consequently, a minimally invasive radical hysterectomy is not recommended.Although there may be a selective group of women for whom minimally invasive radical hysterectomy remains safe, further studies are needed (Ramirez 2018; Cusimano 2019; Chen 2020).",
    "Causes of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy are secondary to the damage of pelvic autonomic nerves that innervate the muscles of the bladder (detrusor muscle), urethral sphincter and pelvic floor fasciae (Zullo 2003; Sellers 2012) .Bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy includes various functional disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as urinary retention, voiding di iculty, urinary hesitancy, urinary tract infection, and urinary stress incontinence (Chen 2002) .",
    "Bladder dysfunction increases the rates of urinary tract infection, hospital visits or admission, patient dissatisfaction, and the need for intermittent self-catheterisation (Manchana 2010) .Bladder dysfunction can also negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), which can lead to embarrassment or even social isolation (Zhou 2016).",
    "Previous studies have demonstrated that a malfunctioning bladder detrusor muscle is a major cause of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Plotti 2011; Laterza 2015) .Contraction of the detrusor muscle of the urinary bladder is stimulated by parasympathetic nerve impulses mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Sellers 2012).Pharmacological therapy for voiding disorders consists of drugs that improve detrusor muscle contraction and those that reduce urethral resistance, which may have a role in the prevention of postoperative bladder dysfunction.",
    "Bethanechol, a cholinergic agent, is a synthetic ester, and is structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine.Bethanechol increases the tone of the detrusor muscle by Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system (Kemp 1997; Madeiro 2006) .",
    "Cisapride is a prokinetic agent.It is principally prescribed for treating gastro-oesophageal reflux in children.The mechanism of action of cisapride is to stimulate the release of acetylcholine, thus promoting detrusor muscle contractility.Hence, as a result of its parasympathomimetic e ect, cisapride may be e ective for treating bladder hypotonia a er surgery (Madeiro 2006) .Cisapride, however, has been restricted to a limited access programme in the USA and Europe because it is associated with serious side e ects, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms) and death (Henney 2000) .",
    "Suprapubic catheterisation (SPC), an insertion of a catheter via postoperative suprapubic cystostomy, has been proposed to hasten the recovery of bladder function compared with an indwelling urethral catheter, by minimising the risks of a urinary tract infection and asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can impede bladder function activity returning to normal (Kidd 2015) .",
    "Bladder training is an important form of behaviour therapy that can be e ective in treating bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy (Goldfarb 1967) ",

    "We used the following measures of the e ect of treatment.",
    " For dichotomous outcomes (e.g.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, rate of urethral catheter removal, rate of urinary tract infections, number of participants with normal detrusor pressure at maximum flow, adverse events), we analysed data based on the number of events and the number of women assessed in the intervention and comparison groups.We used these to calculate the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval. For continuous outcomes (e.g.duration of postoperative retained urethral catheterisation, post-void residual urine volume and QoL measures), we analysed data based on the means, standard deviations and number of women assessed for both the intervention and comparison groups to calculate the mean di erences between treatment arms with their 95% confidence intervals.If the mean di erence was reported without individual group data, we used this to report the study results.If more than one study measured the same outcome using di erent tools, we calculated the standardised mean di erence and 95% confidence interval using the inverse variance method. For time-to-event data (e.g.time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less), we planned to extract the log of the hazard ratio (log HR ) and its standard error from trial reports.If these were not reported, we planned to estimate the log HR and its standard error using the methods of Parmar 1998.",

    "We identified five published reports from four RCTs that included two comparisons of the interventions given to prevent bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer including bethanechol versus placebo and SPC versus ISC.The primary outcomes of this review were the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery and QoL.However, none of the studies reported the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery.In addition, only one trial assessed QoL, but data were insu icient for assessing the e ect of the intervention.",
    "Applicability of evidence is limited by the quantity and certainty of the review results.The lack of data regarding primary outcomes of interest in almost all included studies and the very low certainty of available evidence may impede the applicability of the review findings.It is thus di icult to make any adequate judgements regarding the e ectiveness of the interventions assessed in this review.Additionally, it is important to note that the surgical techniques applied in almost all of the participants were conventional laparotomy radical hysterectomy.Therefore, the results may not be fully applicable to other surgical techniques (i.e.laparoscopic radical hysterectomy or nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy).",
    "In the protocol, we planned to assess the certainty of evidence by eleven relevant outcomes including the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week a er surgery, QoL, time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, adverse events, post-void residual urine volume at one month a er surgery, rate of urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms (Aue-aungkul 2017).",
    "As the review included only four studies, we obtained evidence from few studies and small number of participants for each comparison.Using GRADE assessments, we graded the certainty of the evidence as follows.",
    " Bethanechol versus placebo: information on post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery was downgraded to very low certainty evidence due to important imprecision (combination of sparse data and a low number of events) and unclear risk of selection bias.No information on the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery at one week following the operation, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection in the first month a er surgery, and subjective urinary symptoms were reported under this comparison (see Summary of findings 1).",
    "With assistance from the Information Specialist of the Cochrane Gynaecological, Neuro-oncology and Orphan Cancers Group, we were able to conduct a comprehensive literature search, including a search of the grey literature, conference proceedings and abstracts, citation lists of included studies, and registered databases of ongoing studies.In addition, bias was minimised in terms of the overall review process by following the recommendations in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2019) .",
    "As this review included only four studies, there remains the possibility of publication bias.We did not perform a funnel plot, as the analyses were limited to only one or two studies.Because of the small number of included studies, we did not carry out sensitivity and subgroup analyses as planned in the review protocol (Aueaungkul 2017).None of the review authors have any links to drug companies or financial interest in the prescription of the drug under evaluation, nor did they participate in the conduct of any of the included trials.Therefore, there were no known conflicts of interest of the authors of this review.Kietpeerakool 2019 recently reported a Cochrane Review and metaanalysis assessing the e ectiveness and potential harms of nervesparing radical hysterectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy is a modified surgical technique developed to permit surgical removal (resection) of oncologically relevant tissues surrounding the cervical cancer lesion while preserving pelvic autonomic nerves.This review noted that the nerve-sparing technique may lessen the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction compared to the conventional radical hysterectomy.Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy reduced postoperative bladder dysfunctions in terms of a shorter time to post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less (mean di erence (MD) -13.21 days, 95% CI -24.02 to -2.41; low certainty evidence) and lower volume of post-void residual urine measured one month following operation (MD -9.59 days, 95% CI -16.28 to -2.90; low certainty evidence).",
    "To date, our review is the first systematic review evaluating the e ectiveness and safety of various postoperative interventions for preventing bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy for early-stage cervical cancer.Limited evidence suggested that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed one month a er surgery and better results of urodynamic assessment.The e ectiveness of di erent types of postoperative urinary catheterisation (suprapubic and intermittent self-catheterisation), however, remained unproven by available evidence obtained from RCTs.In a retrospective cohort study conducted among women with early-stage cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy, postoperative SPC was associated with shorter time to trial of voiding and lower urinary tract infection compared to transurethral catheterisation (Wells 2008).",
    "There are no RCTs assessing the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy with a focus on women with early-stage cervical cancer.Three reports of two RCTs assessing bladder training following radical hysterectomy which included women with early-stage and locally advanced-stage cervical cancer failed to note the e ectiveness of this intervention (Santaguida 2012; Fanfani 2015; Gong 2016).One RCT reported in Santaguida 2012 and Fanfani 2015 found that the median duration of time a er surgery to a post-void residual urine volume of 100 mL or less was four days in the bladder training group (range 1 day to 40 days) and three days in the control group (range 1 day to 30 days).Gong 2016 reported no di erence in the risk of urinary tract infections during the first month a er surgery between the women assigned to bladder training (22.9%) and women in the control group (20.3%).Based on these findings, the e ectiveness of bladder training for preventing bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer, therefore, remained unconfirmed.",
    "In general, the studies included in this review are very small, and thus make inferences challenging in the face of very low certainty evidence.None of the included studies reported the primary outcomes and various important secondary outcomes that this review aimed to assess (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery one week a er surgery, time to a post-void residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, and post-void residual urine volumes at 6 and 12 months a er surgery.",
    "Very low-certainty evidence obtained from one small RCT indicated that bethanechol may minimise the risk of bladder dysfunction a er radical hysterectomy by means of lower post-void residual urine volume assessed at one month a er surgery and better results of the urodynamic assessment.However, there was a lack of data regarding clinically important outcomes (i.e.rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, adverse events, urinary tract infection, and subjective urinary symptoms).There was insu icient evidence to indicate whether SPC lessens the risk of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.",
    "In light of the results of this review, bethanechol may be an option for the treatment of bladder dysfunction following radical hysterectomy.However, the benefits and harms of this cholinomimetic drug need to be reassessed in further adequately powered, high-quality RCTs.If this pharmacological intervention can be shown to prevent bladder dysfunction, additional information regarding optimal dose and duration of treatment are required.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "In addition, particular attention should be paid to an assessment of a combination therapy with bethanechol and an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which was shown to be more e ective than bethanechol alone in a previous RCT conducted among patients with various causes of underactive bladder (Yamanishi 2004; Kim 2017).",
    "Importantly, any further studies should encompass an evaluation of the rate of spontaneous voiding recovery, QoL, time to a postvoid residual urine volume of 50 mL or less, post-void residual urine volume, adverse events, and urinary tract infections which are clinically important outcomes for clinical-decision making.Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -Quality of life (EORTC QLQ C30) questionnaire at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks following surgery Notes -The ISC protocol consisted of insertion of a transurethral indwelling catheter at the time of surgery which remained on free drainage until day 5, at which time it was withdrawn and the patient commenced ISC.ISC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs were achieved (minimum 200 mL of urine, at least four hourly during the day, with residual urine volumes of < 100 mL).",
    "-The SPC protocol consisted of insertion of a Bonanno suprapubic catheter at the time of surgery followed by free drainage until day 5 at which time it was clamped.Patients were then requested to pass urine at least every 4 hours during the day following which the RUV was measured by releasing the clamp.SPC was continued until satisfactory frequency/volumes and RUVs as described above were achieved.",
    "During the operation, all patients had an indwelling free draining Foley's catheter.",
    "At the end of the operation, a Becton-Dickenson Bonanno catheter was inserted if randomisation had indicated a suprapubic catheter and the urethral catheter was removed.In those patients randomised to receive urethral catheters, this was le in situ.",
    "Trial of voiding started on the fi h postoperative day.Catheters were removed when the residual urine was ≤ 100 mL.Antibiotics were not administered routinely in the postoperative period.Daily catheter specimens of urine were examined bacteriologically daily until the catheters were removed except in patients who went home with their catheters in situ.",

    "Exclusion criteria included abnormal preoperative bladder function or urinary analysis, urinary tract infection more than 2 times per year, history of renal stone, bladder calculi, urinary incontinence, intraoperative bowel or urinary tract complication, and inability to perform Intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC).",
    "-Control group: suprapubic catheterisation Suprapubic catheter was placed through a small bladder incision and exited through a separated skin incision.The catheter in this group was clamped on day 7 postoperatively for 4 hours and was released after self-voiding to check the post voiding residual (PVR) urine.",
    "-Intervention group: intermittent self-catheterisation (ISC)",
    "The ISC group was managed by indwelling transurethral Foley's catheter for 7 days.On day 6, the patient was instructed to do ISC until she could confidently perform by herself.When the Foley's catheter was removed on day 8, the ISC was performed every 4 hours after each voiding and the PVR urine was recorded.",
