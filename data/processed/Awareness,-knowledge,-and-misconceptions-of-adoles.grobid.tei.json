  "abstract": "Objective: To assess the awareness, knowledge, and misconceptions of young people regarding long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs).Design: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines of MEDLINE-Ovid, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.A random-effects meta-analysis was performed with formal tests for heterogeneity and publication bias.Additional outcomes were summarized using thematic analysis.Setting: Not applicable.Patient(s): Adolescents and young adults (aged 12-25 years) with a uterus.Intervention(s): Not applicable.Main Outcome Measure(s): Patient-reported outcomes related to awareness, knowledge, and misconceptions of LARCs (including intrauterine devices, subdermal implants, and injections) were analyzed.Result(s): Of the 4,077 database citations, we included 40 studies encompassing 10,470 adolescents and young people.Twenty studies were eligible for meta-analysis.The pooled prevalence described that only 65.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51-78) of participants were aware of at least 1 type of LARC (I 2 Â¼ 100).The meta-regression noted that the region, risk of bias, gravidity, sexual history, previous LARC experience, and postsecondary education were not associated with awareness.There were numerous misconceptions regarding eligibility, safety, and usage.Notably, 62% (95% CI, 20-91) did not understand that LARCs could be used in nulliparous individuals, and 37% (95% CI, 21-56) believed that LARCs could cause infertility.There are notable knowledge gaps among adolescents and young people regarding LARCs, such as eligibility criteria, the reversibility of long-acting options, and misconceptions regarding infertility.Clinicians should specifically counsel regarding the suitability for LARCs in nulliparous populations and that LARCs do not cause infertility.",

    "dolescents and young people are high-risk populations for unintended pregnancy, largely due to the inconsistent or ineffective use of contraception (1, 2) .As such, long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) have been highly recommended by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics for adolescent use (3, 4) .Long-acting reversible contraceptives typically include hormonal and nonhormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants (Table 1 ) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) .There is some variability on whether medroxyprogesterone injections are classified as either long-acting or short-acting because their effects last for 3-4 months (4) .Particularly among adolescents, LARCs have higher success, continuation, and satisfaction rates than short-acting contraceptives, such as condoms or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (3, 4) .There is very little user error with LARCs, and recipients can achieve continuous contraception for up to 10 years with certain LARCs, such as the copper IUD (17) .In addition, adolescents do not experience a higher risk of complications from LARCs than older women, despite misconceptions to the contrary (18) .",
    "Despite their numerous benefits, several adolescents and young adults do not seek out LARCs for contraceptive use (19, 20) .The reasons for poor uptake are multifactorial, including the lack of provider or parental knowledge, relative privacy of short-acting contraceptives such as condoms, and high cost of certain LARCs (3) .While patient preference is the priority in contraceptive choice, several adolescents lack the knowledge to properly engage in evidenceinformed decision-making (4) .Across all age groups, studies have noted misconceptions regarding LARCs as well as contraception in general (5, 21, 22) .As LARCs are a relatively new advent in reproductive health, it is important that providers address the potential gaps in knowledge to encourage evidence-informed choices for adolescents and young adults.",
    "The objective of this systematic review was to determine the awareness of LARCs in young people and characterize knowledge gaps, predictors of knowledge, and information sources by adolescents.",
    "This systematic review was conducted according to the standards and guidelines established in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the fourth edition of the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual.We consulted 2 University of Toronto research librarians when developing our search strategy, in addition to having the search strategy peer-reviewed by 2 gynecologists using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines (23) .We systematically searched 3 databases: MEDLINE-Ovid; Embase-Ovid; and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from April 16, 2001, to April 16, 2021 .The cutoff of the last 2 decades was selected to improve the relevance of the review, considering as the Mirena IUD system was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 (24) .",
    "We maintained a broad approach with our search criteria to maximize sensitivity.Our search strategy is included in Supplemental Table 1 (available online).",
    "Only original, peer-reviewed observational studies were examined.Conference posters and abstracts were not eligible for inclusion.",
    "Studies of adolescents and young adults aged 12-25 years with a uterus and/or assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, transmen, and nonbinary people, were eligible for inclusion.The eligible age group was based on cutoffs from previous systematic reviews.We did not include studies specific to cisgender men in our systematic review because we aimed to only assess the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of people who would be eligible for LARC use.We excluded studies that did not report outcomes specific to adolescents or young people (i.e., if the results were combined with other age groups and did not stratify by age).",
    "Articles that did not specifically discuss LARCs or combined outcomes related to LARCs with other methods of contraception or methods of sterilization were excluded from review.Studies were only eligible if either selfreported knowledge or knowledge assessments were included; as such, studies that explored attitudes, barriers, or facilitators beyond knowledge (e.g., cost, fear of pain, and confidentiality) were excluded.Studies in which the objective was solely related to knowledge regarding emergency contraception (e.g., the insertion of a copper IUD for the purpose of preventing implantation of a pregnancy) were also excluded.Articles assessing the knowledge of healthcare providers (HCPs) or healthcare/medical sciences students were excluded.There were no limitations according to language or country of origin.",
    "All steps of the systematic review were performed in duplicate.Study selection was completed by 2 independent, parallel reviewers (M.Y., X.L., or A.K.) for title and abstract screening as well as full-text screening.Any discrepancies were resolved via consensus.Data extraction was also performed by 2 independent reviewers, with 1 reviewer (A.K.) extracting all included articles and an additional reviewer (either M.Y. or X.L.) leading the second round of extraction.Discrepancies were resolved via discussion between the 2 reviewers and subsequent consultation with the third reviewer.",
    "The Covidence platform was used for deduplication, screening, and data management of initial database searches (25) .The manual search was completed using the Scopus platform.",
    "The primary outcome was the prevalence of young people who were aware of at least 1 LARC method.Awareness was defined as whether a participant had heard of an LARC method or could recognize its name.The secondary outcomes included the following: the prevalence of young people who were aware of specific LARC methods (e.g., IUD and subdermal implant); predictors of LARC awareness; specific knowledge and misconceptions surrounding LARC use; and information sources of young people.We conducted both quantitative and qualitative syntheses to summarize the heterogeneous study designs and methodologies.For studies that included cisgender male participants as well as participants assigned female at birth, only outcomes specific to participants assigned female at birth were included in either analysis.",
    "Articles were included in the quantitative synthesis if a questionnaire was as part of the methodology and the entire subset of the study population was surveyed.Articles were included in the qualitative synthesis if they included any patient-reported outcomes related to knowledge or information sources related to LARCs, including but not limited to understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and usage of LARCs.",
    "For the quantitative synthesis, all statistical analyses were conducted through R version 4.0.5.Confidence intervals (CIs) were set at 95%, and P values of < .05were considered statistically significant.I 2 was used to quantify heterogeneity between studies.The prevalence of participants who were aware of at least 1 type of LARC, as well as the prevalence of awareness of specific LARC types (including IUDs, subdermal implants, and injections), was pooled using randomeffects meta-analyses.Prevalence was also pooled for key misconceptions, such as the percentage of participants who believed that LARCs cause infertility, are not suitable for nulliparous people, protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and require daily action.For the primary outcome, univariate random-effects meta-regression was conducted to determine the effects of predictors on participant awareness.Predictors were decided a priori and included the year of publication, region of study, risk of bias, postsecondary education, prevalence of pregnancy, and prevalence of sexual activity.Funnel plots and Egger test were used to assess publication bias (26) .",
    "For the qualitative synthesis, additional knowledge gaps and misconceptions were summarized using thematic analysis determined by 2 independent reviewers (A.K. and X.L.) on the basis of data extraction (performed by A.K., X.L., and M.Y.).",
    "The risk of bias was judged using an adapted tool version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, which has previously been used in other similar studies (27) (28) (29) .",
    "The search yielded 4,077 original database citations after deduplication.Of these, 112 full-text articles were eligible for full-text screening after the manual search.A total of 40 articles were included in the systematic review.",
    "The details of the specific studies are included in Supplemental Table 2 (available online) .",
    "The 40 studies included a total of 10,470 participants.Studies specifically targeted undergraduate students, and 2 studies specifically recruited postpartum adolescents.Most studies were located across the United States (28/40), with the remainder set in Brazil (n Â¼ 1), Ethiopia (n Â¼ 1), Jamaica (n Â¼ 1), the United Kingdom (n Â¼ 3), Botswana (n Â¼ 1), Norway (n Â¼ 1), the Netherlands (n Â¼ 1), or Oceania (n Â¼ 3).",
    "The majority (19/40) included either surveys or questionnaires, with the remainder including interviews (n Â¼ 13), focus groups (n Â¼ 3), or mixed methodology (n Â¼ 5).Eighteen studies were graded as low risk of bias, whereas 22 studies were graded as high risk of bias (Supplemental Table 3 , available online) .",
    "The studies evaluated multiple methods of LARCs, including hormonal and/or nonhormonal IUDs (n Â¼ 38), subdermal implants (n Â¼ 31), and hormonal injections (n Â¼ 13).The results are summarized in Tables 2 and 3 , and forest and funnel plots are shown in Supplemental Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 (available online).",
    "None of the included studies were reported as sponsorinitiated or included conflicts of interest related to pharmaceutical companies that manufacture or sell contraceptive products.",
    "A total of 17 questionnaire-based studies evaluated the primary outcome of LARC awareness (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) .Of the 6,897 participants surveyed, a pooled prevalence of 65.0% (95% CI, 51-78) had awareness of at least 1 LARC method or could recognize at least 1 LARC name.There was significant heterogeneity (I 2 Â¼ 100%).The meta-regression noted that the region (PÂ¼ .078),risk of bias (PÂ¼ .249),prevalence of pregnancy (PÂ¼ .744),prevalence of sexual activity (P Â¼ .859),prevalence of participants who have had tried 1 LARC method (PÂ¼ .869),and proportion of participants who had postsecondary education (PÂ¼ .546)were not significant predictors of LARC awareness.The year of publication noted a potential trend where the awareness of LARCs increased by 13.2% per increasing year of publication, although this trend was not technically significant (P Â¼ .068).",
    "Publication bias was assessed for the primary outcome.Visual inspection of the funnel plot noted some horizontal asymmetry, although Egger test was not significant (PÂ¼ .199).",
    "The random-effects models were performed for the prevalence of participants who had heard of each specific LARC method.In 13 studies of 4,232 participants, there was a pooled prevalence of 60.0% for individuals who had heard of the IUD, although there was high heterogeneity (I 2 Â¼ 97%) (30, (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) .In comparison, 50.0% of participants (n Â¼ 9 studies, n Â¼ 3,315 participants) had heard of the subdermal implant, again with significant heterogeneity (I 2 Â¼ 99%) (30, 33, 34, 36, 39-41, 43, 44) .Only 3 questionnaire-based studies examined whether participants had heard of the long-acting injection, with 80% of 1,351 participants hearing of this method (30, 33, 39) .There was little evidence of heterogeneity for the studies that had heard of the long-acting injection (I 2 Â¼ 36%).",
    "Only 2 studies had comparative data for the number of participants who were aware of OCPs (30, 34) , preventing the meta-analysis of comparison of short-acting methods.They noted that 75 of 90 and 1,037 of 1,067 participants were aware of OCPs, respectively.",
    "We found that 32 of the included 40 studies assessed participants' knowledge related to LARCs.Specifically, 10 of the 32 studies featured objective knowledge assessments, including multiple-choice questions and true/false statements.In contrast, 19 studies assessed patient-reported and spontaneously described knowledge, and the remaining 3 studies assessed both perceived knowledge and objective knowledge.",
    "All included studies identified knowledge gaps related to safety, effects on fertility, mechanism of action, protection from STIs, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and/or usage of LARCs (Table 2 ).Safety.Overall, 19 studies reported knowledge gaps regarding the safety of LARCs, whereas 2 reported satisfactory knowledge.One knowledge assessment noted that 71.0% of adolescent girls and young people did not understand the safety profile of IUDs (37) .Five studies reported the concerns that LARCs were unsafe because of potential infection (36, 47, 48) , cancer (44) , permanent harm (36) , and/or premature menopause (48) .Five studies reported the misconception that the lack of menstruation with an LARC was abnormal and/or unhealthy (42, 44, (49) (50) (51) .Another study noted the fear that IUD insertion could cause death, which was spontaneously reported by a participant.There was also a concern of physical damage to the reproductive system (''There's so much damage that could be done with that.You know, your ovaries and tubes and stuff, those are all really fragile'') (49) .Studies also noted the misconception that subdermal implants could move throughout the body or dissolve within the skin (52) or stick out of the skin (36) or that IUDs could become permanently stuck within the uterus (48) .Another study noted the misconception that the copper IUD could rust within the body, which was spontaneously reported as a fear by 2 participants (64) .Effects on fertility.Ten studies (n Â¼ 4,011 participants) used a questionnaire methodology to assess whether participants believed that LARC use would cause infertility when removed (31-33, 39, 41, 42, 44, 53-55) .A pooled prevalence using the random-effects models noted that 37.0% (95% CI, 21-56) of participants believed that LARCs cause infertility, with significant heterogeneity (I 2 Â¼ 98%, t2 Â¼ 0.85, P < .01).Similarly, 8 additional studies using other methodologies (e.g., interviews and focus groups) found that fear of infertility was a significant barrier to LARC use (36, 46, 47, 49, (56) (57) (58) .",
    "Five studies noted a poor understanding of the mechanism of action of IUDs.Specifically, 3 studies reported that participants did not know that hormonal IUDs contained hormones, specifically progestins (32, 42, 44) .One study noted that 74.2% of participants did not realize that the hormonal effects of IUDs would mean that menstrual flow could be decreased (42) .One study noted that participants incorrectly believed that hormonal IUDs contained more hormones than combined OCPs (49) .In another study, a participant noted the belief that IUDs ''seal the uterus and ovaries'' (59) .Protection from STIs.Three studies used a questionnairebased methodology to assess whether participants understood that LARCs cannot provide protection against STIs (33, 41, 42) .A pooled prevalence of 44.0% of participants understood this disadvantage (I 2 Â¼ 92%).Another interviewbased study found that participants self-identified the lack of protection from STIs as a disadvantage of implants (40) .",
    "Efficacy.Eight studies reported variable understanding of the high efficacy of LARCs (37, 46, 53, (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) .Two knowledge assessments noted that 30.7% and 55.5% of participants understood that LARCs were among the most effective methods of contraception (59) .In 4 studies, participants spontaneously described knowledge that LARCs were extremely efficacious.However, in 2 other studies, participants assumed that LARCs were less effective than other methods, such as condoms or combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs).In another study, 1 participant self-reported that she was concerned that the implant may be less efficacious because it was relatively new on the market (40) .",
    "Eligibility.Nine studies noted the misconception that LARCs, specifically IUDs, are not recommended for nulliparous or young people (32, 36, 41, 42, 53, 57, (61) (62) (63) .Of the 5 objective knowledge assessments, 62% (95% CI, 20-91) of 2,541 participants did not understand that IUDs could be used without prior pregnancy (I 2 Â¼ 99%) (32, 33, 41, 42, 53) .One study noted that HCPs often misinformed adolescent patients about their eligibility because of the misconception that nulliparous women cannot tolerate an IUD (63) .",
    "Insertion.Four studies examined misconceptions related to IUD insertion and LARC use.Two studies noted the misconception that IUD insertion would require surgery and anesthesia (44, 57) .In 1 of the studies, a participant stated: ''I don't want people cutting me open so that they can put that in there'' (57) .Another study noted that participants were surprised by the size of the IUD, believing that it was much larger in width (61) .Finally, 1 study noted the spontaneously reported belief that subdermal hormonal implants could be inserted as tracking devices (52) .",
    "Usage.Three questionnaire-based studies assessed whether participants understood that LARCs did not require daily reminders or action before sexual intercourse (33, 41, 42) .A pooled prevalence of 46% of 337 participants described this understanding (I 2 Â¼ 94%).Four additional interview and focus group-based studies also noted that participants had a mixed understanding of this advantage of LARC use (31, 37, 42, 59, 60, 70, 71) .In 4 studies, several participants did not realize that IUDs could be removed early if desired or not tolerated (32, 44, 50, 53) .In 1 study, it was unclear whether participants realized that implants could be removed early because there was concern in case participants wanted to start a family in <3 years (40) .",
    "Of the 4 studies that examined knowledge regarding side effects, there was variable knowledge.Two studies reported poor knowledge of side effects (32, 42) .Two studies reported a good understanding of implant-related side effects, such as irregular bleeding (41) .",
    "Fourteen studies reported the information sources of the participants regarding LARCs.Common sources included HCPs (n Â¼ 12), friends/family members (n Â¼ 11), the Internet (n Â¼ 2), and advertisements/commercials (n Â¼ 3).Five studies reported that informal sources of information were preferable to HCPs, although 4 studies noted the opposite finding.One study mentioned that participants preferred nurses to physicians as sources of information because of their approachability (61) .Although 3 studies noted that information about LARCs was garnered from sexual education classes, 1 study specifically reported that sexual education classes only discussed condoms and CHCs (64) .",
    "This systematic review describes the awareness, knowledge, and misconceptions of >10,000 adolescents and young people regarding LARCs.After screening 4,077 studies, we included 40 observational studies in our review.We found that over a third of adolescents and young people were not aware of at least 1 LARC method, although there was high heterogeneity in the included studies.The risk of bias, parity, study region, prevalence of postgraduate education, and sexual activity were not significant predictors of awareness.There was a potential trend toward increased awareness with each subsequent year of publication, although this was not significant.There were notable knowledge gaps related to safety, mechanism of action, eligibility, insertion, efficacy, and usage of LARCs.Most prominently, 62% of participants believed that IUDs are not suitable for nulliparous women, and 37% of participants believed that LARCs can cause infertility.",
    "The findings of our review align with the findings of existing literature.Previous studies have noted that young people and adolescents have overall poor knowledge of contraception and sexual health, with several misconceptions perpetuated by social references and mass media (72) (73) (74) (75) .Low-quality sexual education and the promotion of abstinence in schools may also play a role in the weaker knowledge of LARCs, as noted in 1 of our included studies (64, (76) (77) (78) .As such, there has been recent interest in educational programs to promote LARC awareness and knowledge among adolescents and young people.The Contraceptive CHOICE Project noted that when adolescents were counseled thoroughly on all contraceptive methods and offered treatment at no cost, the majority chose LARC methods (79) .Previous initiatives, such as peer-to-peer counseling and iOS applications, have improved the reproductive knowledge and, in turn, long-term contraception use of adolescents (80) (81) (82) (83) .Our findings also highlight the importance of involving friends and family members in these educational programs because of their influence on young peoples' help-seeking behavior (58, 65, 84) .",
    "There are several practical takeaways from this systematic review.For one, it is evident that providers should increase the amount of counseling regarding LARCs because over a third of participants were not aware of LARC methods.However, counseling should be tailored to adolescents and young adults.Specifically, throughout the included studies, there were commonly repeated misconceptions that LARCs can impact fertility or are not suitable for nulliparous people.On the basis of the findings of this systematic review, we suggest that these misconceptions are clarified routinely at contraceptive visits for young people because participants may not readily share these concerns.Educational materials for young people should also dispel these 2 misconceptions specifically.Similarly, it is concerning that several studies have noted that physicians often propagated the misconception that IUDs are not suitable for young people.Past research of provider perspectives has noted similar findings that several physicians believe that IUDs are not suitable for nulliparous women (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) (90) (91) .As such, medical school curriculums and continuing education courses should ensure that HCPs are adequately educated regarding LARC guidelines in young people.",
    "Further research should also be conducted to determine differences between international contexts because most of our included studies were in the United States.For example, according the 2019 United Nations Contraceptive Use by Method data booklet (92), Canada's estimated prevalence of IUD use among women of reproductive age in 2019 was 1.6%, whereas in the United States, it was 8.3%.It is possible that decreased usage rates in Canada could signify decreased understanding of LARCs, in addition to variations in availability and pricing.Another example is that the Nexplanon subdermal implant only recently approved by Health Canada in 2020 (93) .Our systematic review notes that participants had low awareness of the implant as well as misconceptions regarding its safety and efficacy, even in countries such as the United Kingdom and United States that have approved subdermal implants for longer periods of time.As such, HCPs should continuously update their counseling on the basis of the most current options for their unique context.",
    "Ultimately, it is important for adolescents and young people to receive accurate, thorough contraceptive counseling.However, we emphasize that the purpose of contraceptive counseling should not be to pressure patients into selecting LARCs as the most suitable option.In addition, counseling alone may not be sufficient to improve adolescent uptake of contraception.Adolescents may face specific barriers to LARCs, such as the lack of autonomy to visit a physician independently or concerns regarding confidentiality (94, 95) .Other barriers may include the high cost of LARCs, which may be alleviated through the free provision of contraception (48, 79, 96) .Others may prefer the systemic effects of CHCs for the protection against acne or the dual benefit of condoms for STI protection (4).Several young patients also report a fear of peri-insertional pain with IUDs and pelvic examinations, which providers should acknowledge through increased efforts to improve patient comfort (48) .For example, there is growing evidence that lidocaine gel and paracervical blocks may improve IUD peri-insertional pain among nulliparous patients specifically, although further evidence is required (97-101).In addition, there should be ample opportunities to strengthen pelvic examination skills as well as IUD insertion (e.g., workshops and simulation) to improve provider familiarity before LARC provision to young people and adolescents (102-104).Therefore, beyond providing information, contraceptive provision should be tailored to the patient's unique preferences, concerns, and expectations.",
    "The strengths of our systematic review include our robust and rigorous search of 3 databases, including screening of all citing articles and citations via Scopus.We consulted 2 University of Toronto research librarians when developing our search strategy, in addition to having the search strategy peer-reviewed by 2 gynecologists using the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies guidelines.In addition, we did not apply any exclusions on the basis of language or country of origin.We conducted a robust meta-analysis with statistically sound methodology and guidance from multiple statisticians.",
    "Our most significant limitation was the high degree of heterogeneity of the included studies.As such, the pooled results should be taken with caution, and further research is warranted in the field.Explanations for heterogeneity were thought to include the risk of bias, year of publication, and region as well as the participants' gravidity, sexual history, previous LARC experience, or education level.As such, a meta-regression was performed using these predictors but did not reach significance for any of these variables.Ultimately, the reproductive knowledge of young people is a complex social phenomenon that may involve specific cultural beliefs or attitudes, school systems' sex education curriculums, parenting strategies, or local availability of contraceptives.As such, heterogeneity of beliefs may not be captured by traditional reporting in medical journals and require further investigation through systematic and ethnographic study.",
    "Other limitations included publication bias because we did not examine gray literature.Instead, we only examined peer-reviewed literature for the sake of methodologic quality and method transparency.Furthermore, we only included articles that self-identified as studying knowledge related to LARCs in their title or abstract as well as articles flagged via the manual search.Therefore, as with any systematic review, there is a potential for articles to have been missed in our systematic search, although we have taken several steps to avoid the potential for missed articles.In addition, because we included a broad range of studies, findings may not be generalizable to all geographic regions, health systems, or study populations.We also did not report findings specific to cisgender male participants in our review, who may have partners who can become pregnant.As partners can significantly influence the contraceptive choice of young people, future initiatives should address the previously documented evidence gaps of cisgender male participants (65, 105-107).Finally, future studies may also investigate patient perceptions and knowledge gaps of LARCs in contexts other than contraception, such as the use of the hormonal IUD for endometriosis because the IUD is underused for this purpose as well (108).",
    "In conclusion, there are notable gaps in the understanding of LARCs among adolescents and young people, which may influence evidence-informed decision-making.Healthcare providers should specifically counsel young people about the suitability for LARCs in nulliparous populations as well as the safety of LARCs for future fertility.",
