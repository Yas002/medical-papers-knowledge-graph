    "Developments in ultrasound assessment of pregnancy has resulted in the increasing diagnosis of antenatal fetal issues.Many structural fetal conditions as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies have the potential for in-utero treatment to improve both pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.Procedures such as laser ablation for twin-twin syndrome or cord occlusion for selective fetal termination require fetal immobilisation.Immobilisation of the fetus can occur through administration of medication to the mother or directly to the fetus.This improves procedural success and reduces the ongoing risk to the pregnancy.Evidence regarding the best medication and mode of delivery helps to ensure the optimal decision is made for both the mother and the fetus.",
    "To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes.",
    "We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (10 May 2021), and reference lists of retrieved studies.",
    "We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including published abstracts) which compared di erent classes of medication administered to the mother or fetus to allow in-utero procedures to be performed.We also included cluster-randomised trials but excluded cross-over trials.",
    "We used the standard Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth methods for data collection and analysis.Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy.",
    "One study with three trial reports met the inclusion criteria.This involved 54 women with a multiple pregnancy.The study was conducted in a tertiary European hospital maternal-fetal medicine unit and compared remifentanil to diazepam for fetal immobilisation and maternal sedation during fetoscopic surgery.",
    "Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may reduce fetal movement more than diazepam for two outcomes of fetal movement, one of fetal immobilisation at 40 minutes using a visual analogue score (VAS) (where 0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility), and one of gross body and limb movements (score was absolute number of movements), both assessed by a sonographer evaluating a taped ultrasound sequence (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62 and MD -10.00, 95% 1 study, 50 women) .",
    "Surgeons may also report being more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil rather than diazepam (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).However, maternal respiratory rate may decrease more during the surgical procedure with remifentanil compared with diazepam (MD -6.00, 95% CI -8.29 to -3.71; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence).Maternal sedation may also be worse with remifentanil compared with diazepam (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.65; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence) measured using an observer assessment of alertness/sedation (where a score of < 4 equates to profound sedation and > 4 equates to insu icient sedation).Perinatal mortality and time taken to perform the procedure were not reported in the trial.",
    "We prespecified 20 outcomes and planned to use GRADE for 6 of them, all other outcomes were not able to be reported against for the purpose of meta-analysis due to data not being provided or unable to be interpreted.",
    "We assessed the included study at low risk of selection bias (appropriate random sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (outcome assessors were blinded), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data minimal), and reporting bias.",
    "Our GRADE assessment for certainty of the evidence indicates that there is low certainty of the evidence.",
    "We were only able to include one study with a small number of women, from a single centre, a European tertiary hospital.This study was published in 2005 with an abstract of this trial published in 2004.This study evaluated two intravenous medications administered to the mother -remifentanil and diazepam.This study reported our prespecified primary outcome but only evaluated several of our secondary outcomes, which limited further assessment.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure.However, maternal sedation and depression of breathing may be worse with remifentanil.",
    "Further high-quality RCTs assessing both fetal and maternal medications are required to evaluate their e icacy for fetal immobilisation as well as safety for both mother and fetus.",
    "We looked for evidence from randomised controlled trials on the e ectiveness of anaesthetic and pain relief medication for preventing fetal movements (fetal immobilisation) to allow surgical and other invasive procedures to be performed safely on the unborn fetus whilst still in the mother's uterus.",
    "Use of ultrasound during pregnancy has made great advances resulting in increased diagnosis of problems with the development of unborn babies.Many structural fetal problems as well as complications associated with multiple pregnancies can be treated while babies are still in the mother's uterus.Many problems generally require treatment before birth, for example a blockage in the airways.We set out to determine which medications are e ective at providing fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures to be performed, as well as looking at the e ect on the mother in terms of sedation and pain relief.For these procedures to be performed safely, fetal movements may need to be reduced.This can be done by giving medication either to the mother (usually by injection into a vein) or directly to the fetus (by injecting into fetal muscle).",
    "Treatment of structural issues such as lung or heart problems can greatly improve pregnancy and newborn outcomes.Similarly, with multiple pregnancy complications such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome, where there is unequal sharing of the one placenta between the twins.Providing the best surgical conditions with reduced fetal movements means that the procedure can be performed safely and reduces complications such as preterm birth.It is also important to provide a safe environment for the mother without side e ects such as oversedation or lack of pain relief during the procedure.",
    "What evidence did we find?",
    "We searched for evidence from randomised controlled trials to May 2021 and identified one eligible trial involving 54 pregnant women.All were women with a multiple pregnancy in their second trimester attending a European hospital for specialist care.The women received intravenous injection of either remifentanil or diazepam to immobilise the fetus and to sedate the mother during fetoscopic surgery.This is where a small instrument (laparoscope) is inserted through the mother's abdominal wall and into the uterus to see the fetus and placenta.The trial gave low-certainty evidence.The main outcome looked at was how much the baby moved via assessment of body and limb movements.Maternal outcomes were the amount of sedation and depression of breathing.The time for surgery and surgical satisfaction with the procedural conditions were also measured.Low-certainty evidence suggested that remifentanil may be better at reducing fetal movements when compared to diazepam and surgeons were more satisfied with the procedure when using remifentanil.However, the amount of maternal sedation and depression of breathing were worse with remifentanil.",
    "Low-certainty evidence from one small trial means that we cannot be confident in the results.The information available on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes was limited.More high-quality trials are needed to increase our certainty about the longer term fetal and newborn impact of the medication used for fetal immobilisation for in-utero procedures, as well as other medications which may be suitable for use.Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.",

    "The increasing use of advanced ultrasound technologies, in combination with increased multiple pregnancy rates globally and the development of novel procedures to address fetal problems in utero has resulted in more invasive fetal procedures and surgeries being performed during pregnancy.Fetal conditions that may be suitable for in-utero interventions include fetal tumours, lung and airway lesions, cardiac abnormalities, urinary tract abnormalities, and complications associated with monochorionic twin pregnancies.Increasing diagnosis of severe and lifethreatening fetal conditions has also resulted in more frequent termination of pregnancy.",
    "Congenital abnormalities of the urinary tract are relatively common (1/250 to 1000 pregnancies) (Ruano 2011) .Bilateral ureteric or bladder outflow obstruction carries a particularly poor prognosis.Without intervention, LUTO has a perinatal mortality rate of 90% and more than 50% of survivors require renal dialysis or transplantation (Ruano 2011) .Therapeutic interventions include vesicocentesis (draining the fetal bladder with a needle), vesicoamniotic shunting (placing a tube from the bladder into the amniotic cavity) (Kilby 2013) , and fetal cystoscopy (looking at the fetal bladder with a small camera), which can both diagnose and treat posterior urethral valves.Fetal cystoscopy requires maternal epidural or local anaesthesia combined with direct fetal administration of anaesthetic agents (Ruano 2011) .Despite inutero treatment of these conditions, there is ongoing concern regarding the long-term renal function for children with the above conditions (Cheung 2019).",
    "Fetal lung lesions, most commonly congenital cystic adenomatous malformations, bronchopulmonary sequestration (CPAM) or 'hybrid' lesions, occur in 1/10,000 to 35,000 pregnancies (Witlox 2011) .CPAM account for 30% to 40% of all diagnosed congenital lung malformations (Zobel 2019) .While many of these may regress over the course of pregnancy, they may be associated with severe fetal compromise leading to the need for in-utero procedures.These procedures include thoracocentesis (ultrasound-guided needle drainage), thoraco-amniotic shunting (placing a tube from the cyst cavity inside the chest to the amniotic cavity), ultrasoundguided laser coagulation of the arteries that supply the lesion, and open surgical resection of severe lesions (Witlox 2011) .Advances in fetal treatment options have improved survival rates to around 95% (Zobel 2019) .Fetoscopic tracheal occlusion procedures (plugging of the fetal trachea) have been advocated to induce growth and expansion of the hypoplastic (underdeveloped) lung (Van de Velde 2012).",
    "Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in approximately 1:4000 pregnancies with le -sided defects more common than right (Dolk 2010) .These defects o en result in abdominal contents herniating into the thoracic cavity causing fetal lung hypoplasia and resultant neonatal respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension with a significant risk of mortality.In-utero fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) performed early in the third trimester has shown to significantly improve survival and neonatal outcomes (Deprest 2021) .",
    "Fetal heart lesions that may be suitable for intracardiac intervention during pregnancy include stenotic valvular lesions (where there is a critical narrowing of the heart valve), in addition to some other more complicated structural anomalies.In-utero interventions aim to facilitate both the growth and functioning of the heart (Artz 2011) .However, due to the complexity of fetal cardiac abnormalities only approximately 5% of those with major congenital heart disease (CHD) are likely to benefit from in-utero treatment (Gardiner 2019).",
    "A range of spinal lesions can be detected by perinatal ultrasound.Myelomeningocele, the most severe form of spina bifida, may be associated with significant complications including hindbrain herniation, hydrocephalus, as well as both sensory, motor, and bowel/urinary dysfunction (Kabagambe 2018) .In-utero treatment with closure of the spinal defect reduces the duration of time the spinal cord is exposed to amniotic fluid.This is superior to neonatal treatment with improved outcomes, including mental development and motor function, for those who receive in-utero correction (Adzick 2011) .",
    "Sampling of fetal blood via cordocentesis, also known as percutaneous umbilical blood sampling, allows increased diagnostic accuracy for many fetal conditions including fetal anaemia, hydrops, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, and fetal genetic disorders.The ability to access fetal vasculature in utero may enable timely treatment during pregnancy, most commonly fetal red blood cell or platelet transfusions (Fox 2012) .",
    "Monochorionic twin pregnancies share the same placental mass and due to vascular connections there may be discordance in blood supply to each twin, which can result in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).TTTS occurs in up to 15% of monochorionic twin pregnancies, and untreated has a mortality rate of 90% (Chalouhi 2011) .Treatment may involve selective laser coagulation of placental vessels, which involves performing an in-utero procedure (Roberts 2008) .",
    "All types of multiple pregnancy are at risk for 'selective' structural and chromosomal anomalies.As mentioned, monochorionic twin pairs are at particular risk for TTTS and also selective growth restriction.In some of these situations one option for management might be to selectively 'reduce' the fetus with the poor or poorest prognosis in order to prolong pregnancy or to improve outcomes for the remaining fetus/es.Selective reduction procedures all require a fetal intervention and thus fetal immobilisation is an important part of such a procedure.In some settings, for example, late termination of pregnancy with a singleton fetus, feticide prior to induction of labour may be o ered/performed.",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "Fetal interventions performed during pregnancy may involve open fetal surgery with maternal laparotomy, obstetric endoscopy (fetoscopy), and ultrasound-guided needling techniques.During these procedures described above, movement of the fetus increases the technical di iculty of the procedure and may contribute to trauma, as well as increasing the required operating time.Whilst there is much debate surrounding the perception of pain in the fetus, pain transmission can be demonstrated in controlled settings from approximately 16 weeks' gestation, and these pathways are completely developed from 26 weeks.With the recognition of a fetal stress response in response to procedures and in particular to noxious stimuli, e ective fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may modify the fetal response, improve fetal outcome and possibly limit preterm labour (Anand 2001; Brusseau 2013) .",
    "Various methods and routes of administration have been utilised to aid in fetal immobilisation and provide both anaesthesia and analgesia.These include transplacental routes (maternal general anaesthesia and other maternal medications), and combined spinal epidural and local anaesthesia with direct fetal administration of analgesic/anaesthetic medications (intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), or intra-amniotic) (Fink 2011 ).",
    "To date, although the literature describes various routes of administration, their relative advantages and disadvantages and commonly used doses of medication, little is known about shortand long-term safety for the fetus a er such medications are given (Brusseau 2013) .Even simple pharmacokinetic profiles are poorly described for most agents, with the volatile agents best described, for example, isoflurane levels in the fetus reach 70% of maternal levels a er 60 minutes of administration (Brusseau 2013) .",
    "At this time in clinical practice, the choice of anaesthetic and analgesic agents, their dose, and the mode of administration are ultimately determined by the procedure performed, clinical experience, and the medical condition of the fetus.",
    "Open fetal surgery is used for repair of severe fetal lung lesions, and severe spine and spinal cord lesions (such as myelomeningocoele (Adzick 2011 ) and sacral teratomas) (Schwarz 2003) .It requires maternal general anaesthesia (with or without epidural anaesthesia), and fetal anaesthesia, which can be achieved by placental transfer of anaesthetic agents administered to the mother, or additional administration of fetal opioids and muscle relaxants (Van de Velde 2012).There appears to be little consensus on the most appropriate agents for maternal general anaesthesia.Epidural anaesthesia and IV induction agents (thiopental, propofol, etomidate, and ketamine), as well as volatile anaesthetics (inhaled gases, e.g.halothane and isoflurane) have all been used in pregnancy.Newer volatile agents (desflurane, seroflurane) have not yet been studied, but it has been hypothesised that they will undergo rapid placental transfer to the fetus (Tran 2010) .Other agents that are used for their ability to induce both maternal and fetal anaesthesia include thiopental, propofol, diazepam, morphine, remifentanil, and midazolam (Tran 2010) .",
    "Most fetoscopic surgery is well tolerated under maternal local anaesthesia, although maternal regional anaesthesia (spinal, epidural, or combined spinal epidural) is o en used for complex procedures.Combined spinal and epidural anaesthesia provide neither fetal immobilisation or anaesthesia, so additional agents are required (IV maternal agents, or fetal IM/IV opioids and muscle relaxants) (Van de Velde 2012).Agents that have been studied in this setting include remifentanil (a short-acting potent opioid), diazepam, or propofol administered to the woman.Alternative strategies to immobilise the fetus involve the direct administration of anaesthetic agents to the fetus, including fentanyl and pancuronium (either IM or IV into the umbilical vein) (Ruano 2011) .For situations that require complete fetal immobilisation, direct fetal administration of fentanyl, vecuronium, and atropine is o en required.",
    "To ensure an in-utero procedure is successful a medication must be chosen that provides a combination of three pharmacological aspects -analgesia, anaesthesia, and paralysis.The type and level of complexity of the procedure being performed and the degree of immobilisation required contributes to which medication may be chosen.For example, complete immobilisation is required as well as providing analgesia/anaesthesia for the fetus during fetal blood sampling.However, some movement may in fact be advantageous to gain access to the placental vessels when performing laser procedures for the treatment of twin-twin syndrome.",
    "Successful fetal anaesthesia and analgesia reduce fetal movements, which in turn may result in a reduction in fetal trauma during surgery, reduced surgical technical di iculty with increased surgical success, and shorter operating times.Furthermore, fetal anaesthesia and analgesia may reduce the fetal stress response to painful stimuli, and may prevent long-term adverse neurodevelopmental and behavioural responses to pain (Fink 2011) .",
    "It is also important to consider how a medication may a ect the woman with evaluation of maternal sedation versus no sedation as well as maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus none.A safe maternal environment is required to ensure there is no subsequent fetal harm.",
    "The increasing frequency of fetal surgery and other interventions during pregnancy requires the assessment of perioperative pharmacological interventions during fetal surgery and invasive procedures.",
    "To assess the e ects of perioperative pharmacological interventions for fetal immobilisation during fetal surgery and invasive procedures on fetal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes.",
    "Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the following interventions: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus nothing, fetal paralysis versus nothing, combinations versus nothing, one intervention versus another.",
    "Trials using a cross-over design or cluster-randomised trials were not included.We included studies presented as abstracts if enough information was presented for us to make an assessment.",
    "Women with fetal conditions undergoing invasive fetal interventions or fetal surgery including fetal blood sampling and transfusion, fetal bladder drainage and stenting, fetal pleural e usion drainage and stenting, fetoscopy for laser ablation to treat twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, fetal tracheal occlusion, fetal spina bifida repair and EXIT procedure.",

    "One trial Van de Velde 2005 with three reports, involving 54 women, was included in this review.This trial compared remifentanil to diazepam (i.e. one intervention versus another).We did not find any other studies to assess any of the other comparisons that had been prespecified when planning the review.Therefore, meta-analysis was not possible.",
    "Four women were excluded due to fetuses that were immobile at the beginning of the surgery.The remaining 50 women were randomised to either remifentanil or diazepam.",
    "Our planned prespecified comparisons included: maternal sedation versus no sedation, maternal analgesia/anaesthesia versus no analgesia/anaesthesia, fetal paralysis versus no fetal paralysis, combinations versus nothing, and one intervention versus another.",
    "The comparison utilised in this one included trial, fits under our prespecified comparison category of one intervention versus another.As diazepam is a sedative (benzodiazepine class) and remifentanil is an analgesic, the comparison is of maternal sedation versus maternal analgesia/anaesthesia.There were therefore no other comparisons that could be included/reported in our review.",
    "Our primary outcome was degree of fetal immobilisation as defined by trial authors.The authors of the trial assessed fetal mobility in two ways -by taping fetal movement with ultrasound with subsequent evaluation by sonographer and providing a score, and also counting the gross body and limb movements: Fetal mobility was assessed, before, during, and a er surgery by taping 5minute ultrasound sequences of fetal movement every 20 minutes throughout surgery and 10, 20, 30 and 60 minutes a er the end of surgery.These sequences were evaluated by an experienced ultrasonographer.Two types of evaluation were performed: a VAS score for mobility (0 = immobile and 100 = baseline mobility) (which the authors also refer to as 'fetal immobilisation score') and the number of gross body movements and limb movements per 5-minute period (number of fetal movements).In this clinical situation a lower score for both parameters would be more favourable, as a less mobile fetus will facilitate a more successful procedure.",
    "When aligning the trials outcomes with our prespecified outcome, we chose to use the fetal mobility assessment 40-minute time point, as it was in the middle of the surgical time frame and also data extraction from the paper was feasible as clearly stated in writing (other data were only reported on graphs and could not be extracted).",
    "The results suggested that remifentanil may result in less fetal movement (i.e. more fetal immobilisation), when compared with diazepam, as evaluated by the fetal immobilisation score (subjective surgical and objective ultrasound scores) (mean di erence (MD) -65.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -69.38 to -60.62; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.1).",
    "The number of fetal movements may be decreased from 18 ± 3 to 2 ± 1 at 40 minutes of surgery in the remifentanil group, with a much smaller e ect on fetal movement reduction in the diazepam group (MD -10.00, 95% CI -11.62 to -8.38; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.2).",
    "Technically successful procedure as defined by trial authors",
    "In addition to the evaluation of fetal immobilisation by sonographers reviewing taped periods of the procedure on ultrasound, evaluation of fetal mobility and the procedure was also performed by the surgeon and assessed on a four-point scale: At the end of the intervention the surgeon assessed overall fetal immobility and operating conditions using a four-point scale, this subjective score represented an overall subjective impression and is further referred to as the surgical assessment/satisfaction score, 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = moderate and 4 = inadequate immobilisation.",
    "We have chosen to use the reported outcome of 'surgical assessment/satisfaction score' and align with our prespecified outcome of technically successful procedure.",
    "The results suggest that the surgical assessment/satisfaction score may be better in the remifentanil group.It was assessed by the surgeon as being good to excellent (score of 1 or 2) in 92% of women in the remifentanil group, whereas this was 32% in the diazepam group (risk ratio (RR) 2.88, 95% CI 1.60 to 5.15; 1 study, 50 women; low-certainty evidence; Analysis 1.3).",
    "The included study did not report this outcome nor any data that we could utilise to report on it.",
    "Van de Velde 2005 reported that the time to complete the surgery was significantly longer in the diazepam group, 80 (60 to 90) minutes versus 60 (54 to 71) minutes in the remifentanil group.The included data were only reported with medians/ranges and thus were not suitable for analysis, nor able to be included in further tables, and are reported narratively.",
