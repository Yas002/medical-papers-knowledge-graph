    "Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation, occurs in ten percent of all pregnancies.PTB is responsible for more than half of neonatal and infant mortalities and morbidities.Because cervical insu iciency is a common cause of PTB, one possible preventive strategy involves insertion of a cervical pessary to support the cervix.Several published studies have compared the use of pessary with di erent management options and obtained questionable results.This highlights the need for an up-to-date systematic review of the evidence.",
    "To evaluate the benefits and harms of cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth in women with singleton pregnancies and risk factors for cervical insu iciency compared to no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage or bedrest.",
    "We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.govand the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 22 September 2021.We also searched the reference lists of included studies for additional records.",
    "We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing cervical pessary with no treatment, vaginal progesterone, cervical cerclage or bedrest for preventing PTB.We excluded quasi-randomised trials.Our primary outcome was delivery before 34 weeks' gestation.Our secondary outcomes were 1. delivery before 37 weeks' gestation, 2. maternal mortality, 3. maternal infection or inflammation, 4. preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, 5. harm to woman from the intervention, 6. maternal medications, 7. discontinuation of the intervention, 8. maternal satisfaction, 9. neonatal/paediatric care unit admission, 10. fetal/infant mortality, 11. neonatal sepsis, 12. gestational age at birth, 13. harm to o spring from the intervention 14. birthweight, 15. early neurodevelopmental morbidity, 15. late neurodevelopmental morbidity, 16. gastrointestinal morbidity and 17. respiratory morbidity.",
    "Two review authors independently assessed trials for eligibility and risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness based on criteria developed by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Review Group, extracted data, checked for accuracy and assessed certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.",
    "We included eight RCTs (2983 participants).We included five RCTs (1830 women) in the comparison cervical pessary versus no treatment, three RCTs (1126 pregnant women) in the comparison cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone, and one study (13 participants) in the comparison cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage.Overall, the certainty of evidence was low to moderate due to inconsistency Cochrane Library Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "We searched for studies that examined cervical pessary compared with any other treatment, or no treatment, in women with singleton pregnancy who were at risk of having cervical weakness.We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes.",
    "We found eight randomised studies (where participants were randomly assigned to their treatment group) involving 2983 pregnant women.We were able to extract data for three comparisons: cervical pessary versus no treatment, cervical pessary versus progesterone, and cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage.The studies took place in 15 high-income countries.",
    "In women with singleton pregnancy, the use of cervical pessary may decrease the risk of preterm birth compared to no treatment or vaginal progesterone, although the evidence around this was not robust.It is unclear if cervical pessary has an e ect on maternal infection or other outcomes related to the baby for all comparisons.",
    "We have little confidence in the evidence because the results varied widely between studies and there were not enough studies.Future studies are needed to confirm the beneficial e ect of cervical pessary on preterm birth.They should include lower-income settings so that the findings can be applied to a wider population.",

    "An earlier Cochrane Review on cervical pessary for preventing preterm birth (PTB) included both singleton and multiple pregnancy (Abdel-Aleem 2013).That review was split into two new reviews to cover the populations in separate analyses (women with singleton pregnancy (this review) and women with multiple pregnancy).",
    "PTB, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, occurs in around 10% of all births (Institute of Medicine 2011), and is one of the leading causes of infant mortality (70%; Blencowe 2012; Bolbocean 2022 ; Ngoc 2006 ; O ice of National Statistics 2012).Indeed, perinatal morbidity and mortality are inversely related to gestational age at delivery (D'Onofrio 2013; Saigal 2008) .Premature neonates represent a large economic burden (Liu 2012) .",
    "Cervical insu iciency is a common cause of PTB, but it is di icult to diagnose, owing to the multifactorial aetiology of second trimester miscarriage and spontaneous PTB.Diagnosis is o en based on medical history, clinical examination or ultrasound examination during pregnancy.Typical risk factors include having two or more second-trimester pregnancy losses, having prelabour rupture of membranes before 32 weeks' gestation, a history of cervical trauma caused by cone biopsy, forced dilation or intrapartum cervical lacerations or congenital uterine anomalies (Lo 2009; Wie 2021) .",
    "Other possible risk factors are clinical findings during pregnancy of short cervix, dilated cervix, protruding membranes or cervical tear; and ultrasound findings of short cervical length, defined as less than 25 mm at 20 weeks' gestation (Owen 2004; Wie 2021) , or funnelling of the cervix during the second or early third trimester of pregnancy (Ayers 1988) .",
    "Cervical cerclage is one strategy aimed at preventing premature opening of the cervix (Anthony 1997; Gibb 1995; McDonald 1957; Shirodkar 1955) .All operations carry risks, and cervical cerclage is an invasive technique that requires anaesthesia and is associated with complications including haemorrhage, infection and miscarriage (McDonald 1957; Shirodkar 1955) .One Cochrane Review (15 trials, 3490 women) concluded that cervical cerclage reduces the risk of PTB in high-risk women and probably reduces the risk of perinatal death.Whether cerclage is more or less e ective than other preventive treatments remains unclear (Alfirevic 2017).",
    "Administration of progesterone has been also advocated for preventing PTB in singleton pregnancy (Jarde 2019) One Cochrane Review on this topic included 36 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 8523 women and 12,515 infants, and found that in women with a history of spontaneous PTB, progesterone reduces the risk of perinatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.75) and delivery before 34 weeks (average RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.69) compared to placebo (Dodd 2013) .",
    "The strategy of using cervical pessaries for managing cervical insu iciency was introduced in the 1950s (Arabin 2003); however, support for this approach has been inconsistent over the subsequent decades (Acharya 2006; Antczak-Judycka 2003; Arabin 2003; Quaas 1990) .",
    "The cervical pessary is a specially made silicone device that is inserted into the upper vagina to support the cervix and prevent PTB (Goya 2012; Hui 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017) .Most studies investigating this device have used the Arabin pessary, which is a flexible, ring-like pessary available in di erent sizes (outer diameter 65 mm or 70 mm, inner diameter 32 mm or 35 mm, height of the curvature 21 mm or 25 mm).A clinician examines the cervix using a speculum to determine the appropriate pessary dimensions.The pessary is inserted with its curvature upwards so that the larger diameter is supported by the pelvic floor.The smaller inner diameter should encompass the cervix.A er inserting the pessary, the clinician should ensure the pregnant woman has no uterine activity, discomfort or vaginal bleeding (Arabin 2003; Saccone 2017).",
    "The mechanism by which the pessary can prevent cervical insu iciency (also called incompetent cervix) is not exactly known.",
    "In 1961, Vitsky suggested that the incompetent cervix is aligned centrally, with no support except the non-resistant vagina (Vitsky 1961) .A lever pessary, however, would change the inclination of the cervical canal, directing it posteriorly.Thus, the weight of the pregnancy would be more on the anterior lower segment (Arabin 2003) .Another postulated mechanism is that the pessary supports the immunological barrier between the chorioamnion-extraovular space and the vaginal microbiological flora; cerclage may work in the same way (Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).",
    "Cervical pessary is a minimally invasive intervention for preventing PTB.Non-randomised trials have shown that treating women with a short cervix with cervical pessary prolonged the pregnancy compared to expectant management.In such trial, mean gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks (range 36 weeks 6 days to 41 weeks) in the pessary group and 33 weeks (range 26 weeks 4 days to 38 weeks) in the control group, with a P value of 0.02 between the groups (Arabin 2003).",
    "Cervical pessary insertion is an outpatient procedure that does not require anaesthesia, surgery or medications.In one multicentre RCT conducted in Spain, the only reported side e ects of this intervention were increased vaginal discharge and expulsion of the pessary (Goya 2012).In this and other studies, there were no serious infectious complications reported during or a er removal of the pessary (Goya 2012; Quaas 1990; Jin 2017) .",
    "Previous Cochrane Reviews of cervical pessaries included studies on singleton and multiple pregnancies (Abdel-Aleem 2010; Abdel-Aleem 2013).The results of meta-analysis conducted by Jin and colleagues in 2017 showed that the available evidence did not support the use of cervical pessary in singleton pregnancy with short cervix, and they recommended more RCTs on this topic (Jin 2017) .",

    "Another limitation of the review is that the definitions of the outcomes were mainly based on CROWN consensus and do not exactly match those defined in the included studies (van 't Hoo 2016).This limited the number of reported outcomes in relation to prespecified outcomes.Moreover, outcomes such as chorioamnionitis, vaginal discharge or neonatal RDS, which were not prespecified in the CROWN consensus, are of clinical importance in this population.In addition, some studies reported outcomes in units other than those specified in the review and could not be included in the analysis.",
    "In the second comparison (cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone), we found substantial heterogeneity among studies",
    "Trusted evidence.Informed decisions.Better health.",
    "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for the primary outcome.While Pacagnella 2022 reported a reduction in delivery before 34 weeks in the pessary group, Care 2021 and Cruz-Melguizo 2018 did not.The reasons outlined above for the first comparison could explain the heterogeneity between studies.",
    "We identified 16 registered ongoing studies.The publication of results has been delayed in many cases, which reflects the di iculty of conducting RCTs in this area (Characteristics of ongoing studies).",
    "Despite the diversity of data included in our meta-analysis, overall there is evidence of a possible reduction in the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks with the use of cervical pessary compared with no treatment or vaginal progesterone, although the results of all of these meta-analysis do not rule out the possibility of no e ect or a small increase in PTB.One previous Cochrane Review on this topic included both singleton and twin pregnancy and identified only one eligible study (Goya 2012); the evidence suggested that cervical pessary may reduce PTB compared no treatment, in line with our results (Abdel-Aleem 2013).",
    "However, our findings contradict those of Jin 2017, a review that included three RCTs in the comparison of cervical pessary versus no treatment and showed no benefit of the pessary (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016).Our results also di er from those of Correa 2019, which included five RCTs and found that cervical pessary was not superior to no treatment (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Karbasian 2016; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017).Additionally, a network metaanalysis by Jarde and colleagues included four RCTs (Goya 2012; Hui 2013; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that there was insu icient evidence to reach conclusions for the comparisons of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage, vaginal progesterone and bed rest (Jarde 2019) .Regarding the comparison with no intervention or treatment as usual, Jarde 2019 found that cervical pessary had little or no e ect on prevention of delivery before 34 weeks, but may have reduced delivery before 37 weeks.Our systematic review showed a potential protective e ect of cervical pessary compared to no treatment in prevention of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks, but with very marked heterogeneity and wide CIs that crossed the line of no e ect.Another meta-analysis by Perez-Lopez and colleagues included only three studies (Goya 2012; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that cervical pessary compared with no treatment did not reduce delivery before 34 weeks but did reduce delivery before 37 weeks (Perez-Lopez 2019).",
    "The di erence with our review is that Perez-Lopez 2019 did not include two studies that showed no e ect of cervical pessary on PTB (Dugo 2018; Hui 2013).",
    "The diversity of results on the e ectiveness of cervical pessary may be related to di erent phenotypes of PTB.One retrospective study found that in women with short cervix and previous preterm prelabour rupture of membranes, cervical pessary may be a less e ective option (Care 2019).This study highlighted the importance of the phenotype of previous PTB for predicting the treatment e ect.Future clinical trials should take this information into account.",
    "Regarding the second comparison (cervical pessary versus vaginal progesterone), our results di er from those of one meta-analysis by Liu and colleagues (Liu 2019) .It included three RCTS (Karbasian 2016; Nicolaides 2016; Saccone 2017), and found that combined treatment (pessary plus progesterone) was not superior to progesterone alone in prevention of delivery before 34 weeks (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.77).Di erences in the phenotypes of PTB and ethnic background of participants may explain the di ering results.",
    "In women with singleton pregnancy and risk factors for cervical insu iciency, cervical pessary compared to no treatment or vaginal progesterone may reduce the risk of delivery before 34 weeks or 37 weeks of gestation, although these results should be viewed with caution due to uncertainty around the e ect estimates.There is insu icient evidence with regard to the e ect of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage.",
    "Due to the low certainty of evidence in most of the prespecified outcomes and non-reporting of other outcomes, there is a need for further robust randomised clinical trials that use standardised terminology for maternal and o spring outcomes.",
    "There is also a need for data from lower-income countries to ensure generalisability.Further research should concentrate on comparisons of cervical pessary versus cervical cerclage and bed rest.Investigation of di erent phenotypes of preterm birth could be of importance.",
